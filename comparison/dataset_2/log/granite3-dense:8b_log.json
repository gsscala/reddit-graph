My one beef with the product, though, is that the ball is a little tough to get spinning until it is fully lubricated, which means that I often have to use my fingers to get it started, which isn't ideal because I don't want to get any of the flavored juice on me.  That said, my dog is a big fan of this product.  So, while I think this is a good product, I'm giving it four stars because I think the delivery mechanism (ie the ball) isn't the best, and could be improved upon.", "4", 4.0, 4.0, 0.14378456900158199], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

I have been taking nexium for around 2 years and protronix before that. Any food fatty, sweet, high in sugars (bread), or spicy sent me into a ball of pain because of the acid that came from them. I read that apple cider vinegar is supposed to be a fantastic way to control these kinds of problems and far healthier than a dependence on those prescriptions (not to mention cheaper)!<br /><br />I ordered these caps as I had smelled apple cider vinegar as a liquid and it is absolutely disgusting, I don't think I could have even choked it down for its benefits. I got these pills and in the beginning I took them as directed which for the first week or so was hard because my body was very dependent on proton-pump-inhibitors. After that initial week of hell I was able to make due with these pills. Then another week or two later I realized I didn't have any residual pain of those acid flair ups!<br /><br />I have now been off a proton-pump-inhibitor for 6 months successfully! I only take these before particularly fatty, sugary, or spicy meals to aid in keeping acid levels constant. The pills stink pretty bad make no mistake about that, but who cares when you compare the smelly pill to the money you'll save on prescriptions and the side-effects of those meds?! If you have acid reflux or acid issues I absolutely recommend you get a bottle of these and try it.<br /><br />People should also note that the 1star review on here is not related to the product at all, it is in regards to the shipping manner.

He did great on it for all that time.  Great coat, firm stool, easy to maintain weight, and great blood tests at his yearly check-ups.  We were extremely active, with daily runs and walks, play at the park, etc. But digestibility was always a bit on the low side. If I cut the volume of food down, he would loose weight before any noticeable decrease in stool size.<br />I could also use the kibble for training, as he really liked the flavor.<br /><br />My Girl Friend's Rottie is on a mix of this with Canidae All Life Stages.  She is a high drive, work-aholic! Honest, you would be hard pressed to find a more active dog.  She does amazingly well on this.  Stunningly beautiful coat, great digestibility, easily maintained weight.  She has been on this mix for about 2 years now, and she is seven.  No kidney issues with high protein, but we will watch as she ages. Her focus, and attention seems more rock solid too on this mix...<br /><br />At Super-Mutts yearly check-up (when he was 10-1/2) we noticed kidney functions were out of whack.

I read the ingredients again before I ordered this time and it still said ONLY \"Ingredients Xylitol, gum base, peppermint oil (natural flavor), vegetable glycerin (humectant), gum Arabic (texturizer), non-GMO soy lecithin (emulsifier) and beeswax (glazing agent).\" Yes I copied and pasted it here to show you all just in case it gets changed. I refuse gum or anything else that has titanium dioxide in it. Why you ask? Here you read for your self. \"Titanium dioxide has recently been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen ''possibly carcinogen to humans''.\" [...] AND \" Titanium dioxide is an inorganic compound used in a range of body care products such as sunscreens and makeup. It appears to have low skin penetration but inhalation is a concern.\" So I don't want to chew something that is bad if I breath it in.

This will display the individual price for the course (for paid courses).If you want to take a course without a certificate for free, you can choose the \"Audit\" option for many courses (when registering for the course).Course series of several online courses are calledSpecializations. These require payment of a fee (monthly subscription, don't forget to cancel!). However, you can often take the individual courses of the series free of charge (without a certificate).Anyone enrolling for a paid course or Specialization will get access to a7-day trial period. If you are a quick learner, you can sometimes complete a course within the trial phase (and thus possibly even receive a certificate for free!).Some (not all) of thePersonal Development / Career courseshave been criticized by users as being rather superficial. Anyone who is already working and has an academic degree may not learn much in some of these courses.A clear advantage over other course platforms is theeasy navigationwithin courses. Videos, tests, discussion forums and further reading materials are easily accessible.For some courses, a final exam with an assessment by other students is required (Peer Assessment). This often works well, but for smaller courses with fewer participants, it may take some time to get adequate feedback for your work.  ", "3 - Neutral.

Our older cat has had a lot of problems with weight gain and UTI issues. After Science Diet, and Rx, we wanted to give a more natural cat food a chance. This worked wonders!<br /><br />Our 7 year old cat, Isabel, eats some of the Blue Buffalo chicken mixed in with her wet food every day. Her coat is starting to look healthy again with her dandruff going away, her chronic UTI has cleared up, she is beginning to lose a little weight, and she is more active than she has been in the last two years. For the last 12 months, she was becoming more and more lethargic, to the point that we were worried she had a serious illness. Now she chases our younger cat, plays with balls, and is generally in a much happier mood. She is even starting to jump on top of the washing machine to steal her 'sister's' food, whereas a few months ago she could only jump on the couch after a few starter jumps. She also eats less without begging for more food, I think the higher protein is doing a good job of keeping her feeling full.<br /><br />Our younger cat is much pickier than Isabel, and she LOVES this food! I love having a cat food that both of my cats can enjoy and that does not contain corn, wheat, or soy.

VIA is Starbucks' trademark name for their new version of instant coffee.  Before you give up in disgust, stop and think:  would they really blow their name by bringing out something undrinkable like ordinary instant?  No, they're not that stupid, right?  So... there must be something unlike ordinary instant going on here.  Bingo!  Here's how I discovered it:<br /><br />My coffee maker (a Cuisinart GRIND-n-BREW, less than 2 weeks beyond the warranty period, naturally) gave up the ghost just before a big dinner party, and my husband and I aren't eager to make big purchases these days, to put it mildly.  At Sam's Club I ran across a large-sized pack of single-serving little tubes of Columbian VIA and thought, hey, why not -- gives us some more time to decide on our new coffeemaker.  Sam's doesn't sell any decaf VIA, so I had to admit to being out of decaf at the dinner (most of our guests gave up at that point, not wanting to caffeinate themselves so late in the evening), but the few who still wanted coffee were served VIA without knowing it.  All 3 praised our coffee, and I personally thought it was terrific!!  I 'fessed up to everyone's surprise and gave them each a single-serving packet to take home.<br /><br />Since then, I've had nothing but VIA.  Not only do I enjoy it as much as brewed fresh-ground Starbucks coffee, but I absolutely love the convenience of \"brewing\" a single serving whenever I want it, instead of waiting for a whole pot, throwing some of it out after it lingered for an hour or two, and then waiting for a whole new pot later if I want more.  Needless to say, we haven't replaced the Cuisinart, and that was months ago.  (Note:  a single serving is 8 oz., and our porcelain coffee mugs hold 10 oz., so it works beautifully for us, whether a single cup or a dozen:  just put a tube's worth into each mug and add steaming hot water to what you've predetermined is the 8 oz. point).  I also love not having to wonder whether my big bag of whole beans is still fresh or whether to throw out the rest and plunk down serious cash on the next one:  the VIA is fresh each time, so I'm actually spending less per cup than I had been before.  Not to mention the serious pain previously of cleaning the grinding mechanism on the GRIND-n-BREW for every new pot... :(<br /><br />The only problem I originally had was no decaf, so I was giving up drinking any coffee at all after 3 or 4 in the afternoon.  Then, naturally, I found the decaf on Amazon -- HOORAY!!!  I'm about to order my sixth case of this wonderful decaf, which tastes as good as any decaf I've ever had.  The only other place I've ever found the decaf is on Starbucks' own website, and it's cheaper from Amazon, especially if you're a Prime member.  Amazon scores again, and then some.<br /><br />The best part?  How portable it is!!  If you end up agreeing with me that it's as good as \"brewed\", then just imagine being able to take one of these little tubes with you anywhere you go, just add it to 8 oz. of steaming hot water, and then end up with a fresh cup of fabulous-tasting coffee?  Ymmmm...  (Especially nice to have some in my bag for \"emergencies\", such as when a restaurant tells us at the end of a nice dinner out that they don't have any more decaf...)<br /><br />Try both the caffeinated and the decaf -- I'll bet you end up being incredibly glad you did, and I'll bet the two combined save you a lot of time, money and inconvenience.

This tea does not taste like an oolong tea.  I'm sure if they say it's oolong, then it probably is an oolong, but it really tastes more like a green tea.  It's also very mildly flavored.  I find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended.  There's certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea, and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this.  The flower bloom is durable: I put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea, and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating.  If anything, the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew.  Served cold, the flavor comes out even more if you're partial to iced tea.<br /><br />The flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty--nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that Numi shows on their website, and it's as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up.

They were packed very well.  No injuries to report.  Each plant was placed in it's own zippy bag and its roots were wrapped in spagnum moss.  Everything was moist as it should be.<br /><br />I immediately got everything set up, wet down with distilled water, and put in their respective baskets.  I then placed them in a low ceramic dish (I posted pics of this)and they have been happy ever since.<br /><br />I have been putting them outside for a while during the day.

This diet is very restrictive on carbs, but doesn't count calories, so it's pretty easy to follow. Finding bread is almost impossible, so this came as a god-send. I have problems with my breakfasts and this will help. However, it's not really as good as bread, but it will do. I baked my first loaf yesterday, so let me break it down for you.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* doesn't give the house that good fresh bread smell<br />* it's lightly rubbery, nay, bouncy. It is a bit weird, because it doesn't break down like normal bread does when you chew it.<br />* slightly dry<br />* an after taste that reminds a bit of chewing tree, kind of nutty and it lingers for a long time.

Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a \"good\" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought \"stuff\", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!)

Fresh, vibrant colors, the non-pareils (sugar balls) on the outside burst in your mouth as you tasted them.  Yum!<br /><br />However, I was instantly disappointed when the box I ordereed from Amazon arrived, instead of a fresh, vibrant red, the berries that should have been red were a faded, dingy tan-peach color.  The black ones were still black, but when you handled them it left a brown residue on your fingers as if the color was leaching out of them.<br /><br />The color wasn't the only problem-the non-pareils didn't have that \"burst\" quality, they were rather bland and tasted old.  I think the candy was old, or perhaps improperly stored, because it was still within the expiration date by a few months.

When I tried them, I liked them well enough, I suppose, but thought they were nothing to write home about.  I bought some of these, along with the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon flavor in a combo pack, on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  These are excellent.  Think organic, good-tasting Pop-Tarts.  Health food?  Maybe.  More healthy than the \"original\"?  Definitely.  But more importantly, they taste way better.<br /><br />I like this flavor better than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon.  The Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are good, I'd give them a 4 stars even, but these are really, really good.  I like the brightness and slight tartness of these better.  I think it works better with the pastry than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon which is simply rich and sugary.  I am about to get a big box of the Frosted Blueberry to try those out.<br /><br />As an aside, one of the other reviewers commented on wanting some of the sugar replaced with \"natural\" artificial sweetener.  I think this would be a big mistake.  They would taste terrible, and, I think, would go against the idea of having a natural version of a processed product.  I would stop buying them if that happened.

well it is about being a black man living in america. no shit that is what pretty much every rap album has been about ever. except to pimp a butterfly is not just another rap album it is the rap album that the other rap albums were striving to be. for starters it is unapologetically black. the album is about being a successful black man in america. the themes of race are found in nearly every song from wesleys theory king kunta hood politics complexion etc. it all comes to a head at the blacker the berry where kendrick raps about the double-conscious phenomenon that black people in america face in where they need to see themselves from the perspective of white society sometimes leading to racialized self-hatred. it is contradicted two songs later in i where kendrick raps about self-love for the black man. every featured artist aside from anna wise on institutionalized and these walls is a black artist. it is an album made for the black person but it can be loved and appreciated by anyone who is willing to put themselves in the shoes of somebody else kind of like how black people are expected to socially. the music in the album is a special level of impressive. it is catchy it is experimental and it sticks to it is theme of being black. there is not one song that has a bad instrumental. kendrick and the producers seem to be on the same wavelength in terms of vision and execution. songs on this album were so catchy that they spawned several hits including king kunta these walls alright and i. it is a jazz rap album and the music makers behind the project take advantage of that to create instrumentals so out there and creative that you will not find anything of their ilk on any other rap album. these beats are not 808s and synthesizers they are full on jazz breakdown sessions. the funk and crazy jazz that is found in this album screams soul and bebop genres pioneered and lead by black artists. kendrick is on top of his lyrical and vocal game in this album. not only is every song crafted precisely and expertly in his bars as most hip-hop heads already expect from kendricks work but his flows are out of this world on some of these tracks. obvious examples that come to mind can be found in for free? and i. kendrick has also created the only musical project where i believe an oscar for best performance should be awarded to the performer. kendrick raps from the perspective of other people in his songs and he makes them sound like actual other people. you can tell it is kendrick but some of these songs have straight up characters in them. think give me the loot from the notorious b.i.g. you can find some of these verses in institutionalized and you. with that case being made 2. this is the best concept album to ever be released. now that is probably where i lost most of you. bare with me. i think it is impressive that kendrick even made this a concept album at all. rap albums do not tend to take the narrative-concept route due to the nature of their lyric heavy strong structure. a rap album that tells an entire story through every bar and every song would be like listening to an audiobook with a beat in the background. other rap artists have done the concept album with glowing success though. deltron 3030 is a rap album done with the idea that it is a project that comes from the distant future. mm.. food by mf doom is another concept album but it is able to tell a narrative through the skits between the songs and the wordplay that doom creates around food. however not only is to pimp a butterfly a better concept album than the other rap concept albums it is better than any other concept album that is comes before it. that is right i am including all of the rock concept albums that came from the 60s onward. pet sounds sgt. pepper tommy the wall all of them. i hold this belief because of one simple fact. to pimp a butterfly can never be adapted into anything other than as a studio album. i say this because almost every other concept album can be adapted and this is evidenced by the fact that many of these popular concept albums have already been adapted as screenplays for stage and cinema. the wall is one of my favorite albums but if i wanted to experience it a different way i can always just watch the movie. to pimp a butterfly can never be a movie. the narrative of the album is driven through the poem that kendrick recites and reveals a little bit more of every time he reads it. the poem is found between songs and the song that follows the poem always relates directly to the segment that kendrick just revealed. kendrick finishes the poem after his rap segment in the final track mortal man. kendrick begins to elaborate on the poem and slowly reveals that the entire album is the context for a conversation that kendrick is having with deceased hip-hop hero 2pac. after conversing with his idol kendrick reads another poem. the poem reflects the story of the caterpillar and it is transformation into the butterfly a metaphor for the journey of a black man and finding balance between the two sides that consume him. the poem features the titles of songs on the album and ties all loose ends. to pimp a butterfly is an album that we will be looking back on for decades. it is our generations the velvet underground  nico it is our dark side of the moon our in utero. it is the defining album of our decade. it is brilliant in every facet that a studio album needs to be. the music is there and it goes above and beyond. the artist and his performance is powerful and striking. the idea of the album is ambitious in itself and it goes above what it needs to reach that level of excellence. it is necessary listening to anybody who claims to love hip-hop. to love music. it is an album that changed my life and it can change yours too.", "3", 3.0, 5.0, 0.6058139829983702], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

People who usually like creamy milk chocolate would probably not like this bar for a number of reasons:<br />1) It's 70% dark chocolate, which means the cocoa butter/fat content is much lower, and therefore the texture will be not as fatty/creamy<br />2) It's extremely pure with very few additives which lends itself to a more cocoa-based flavor (if you've never eaten raw cacao nibs or you have and you hated them, again, not for you).<br /><br />I'm not trying to be a snob, but I do think that to work up to a product like this takes some time and development of one's palette and taste.
