The user says they have a new favorite musical. That phrase \"favorite\" usually has a positive connotation because it suggests enjoyment or preference. So that part sounds positive.\n\nBut then there's a twist: they mention that they're not even a fan of the genre. This adds some complexity to their sentiment. On one hand, they are enjoying this particular musical enough to call it their favorite, which is positive. But on the other hand, they don't typically like the genre as a whole, so maybe they weren't expecting to like it but did anyway.\n\nSo putting that together, the overall sentiment seems positive because they found something they like despite not being into the genre. It might even express some surprise or pleasant unexpectedness. However, since they're not usually a fan, it's not extremely positive; it's more of a mild positive sentiment.\n\nI think 3 would be appropriate here because while it's positive, it doesn't seem overly enthusiastic given that their usual preference isn't for musicals.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence expresses a positive sentiment with some surprise. The user unexpectedly likes the musical despite not being a fan of the genre.\n\n3", 3, 3, 50.850781215995084], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user provided a specific example with \"the salton sea\" and mentioned that it has moments of inspired humor but every scrap is of the darkest variety.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. \"Moments of inspired humour\" sounds positive because 'inspired' suggests creativity and 'humour' is generally a good thing. So that part is positive, maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nBut then it says \"every scrap is of the darkest variety.\" The word 'darkest' usually implies something negative or intense. It could mean that while there are humorous moments, they're offset by very dark or serious content. That might bring down the overall sentiment.\n\nSo combining both parts: positive humor but with a heavy, dark twist. I'm thinking it's not entirely negative because of the humor, but the darkness adds negativity. Maybe somewhere in between neutral and negative?\n\nThe scale is 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). Since there are both elements, perhaps it's around 1 or 2. The 'inspired humour' might make it slightly better than just negative, so maybe a 2 for neutral or leaning towards negative.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if the darkness overshadows the humor enough to be negative, but given that it's all dark, maybe it tips into being more negative overall. So I think the sentiment is 1.\n</think>\n\nThe text mentions both positive and negative elements. \"Inspired humour\" suggests positivity, while \"darkest variety\" indicates negativity. The balance leans slightly towards negative due to the intensity of the darkness described.\n\n1", 1, 3, 35.03539589798311], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the phrase itself: \"who knew ...\". It seems like an incomplete sentence, which might make it a bit tricky to assess the sentiment accurately. The ellipsis (...) suggests that there's more to the thought or maybe it was cut off. However, without additional context, I have to work with what's given.\n\nThe phrase is commonly used in situations where someone expresses surprise or realization about something they didn't know before. For example, \"Who knew she could cook?\" or \"Who knew this would happen?\" Depending on the context, it can carry different sentiments.\n\nIn some cases, \"who knew\" can be neutral, just stating a fact without any strong emotion. Like in an informative sentence: \"Who knew that bees are essential for our ecosystem?\" Here, it's just providing information.\n\nOn the other hand, it can also have a positive or negative connotation. If someone says, \"Who knew this project would turn out so well!\" that's definitely a positive sentiment. Conversely, if they say, \"Who knew things could get this bad,\" it's expressing a negative feeling.\n\nGiven that the provided text is just \"who knew ...\", without any context, it's challenging to determine the exact sentiment. However, since it's presented as an independent statement with an ellipsis, I might lean towards considering it neutral because there's no explicit positive or negative language used. It could be leading into either a positive or negative point, but on its own, it doesn't convey a strong emotion.\n\nAdditionally, considering the structure of the question, it's asking for classification without any context beyond that one phrase. Without more information, assigning a neutral sentiment (2) seems appropriate because there's no clear indication of positivity or negativity.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 2, 42.996808550989954], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is: \"like a child with an important message to tell ... -lrb- skins ' -rrb- faults are easy to forgive because the intentions are lofty .\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. It starts by comparing someone to a child with an important message. That could be neutral or positive depending on context. Then it mentions that \"faults are easy to forgive.\" The word \"forgive\" suggests that there were mistakes, but they're being overlooked because of the good intentions.\n\nThe phrase \"intentions are lofty\" means the goals or motives are high-minded or noble. So even though there might be faults, the overall sentiment is positive because the intentions are seen as good and worth\u539f\u8c05ing any shortcomings.\n\nPutting it all together, the text seems to have a positive outlook. The person's heart is in the right place, which makes up for any flaws. Therefore, the sentiment should be on the higher end of positivity but not extremely so. I think 3 (positive) fits best here because while there's acknowledgment of faults, the focus is on the positive intentions.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a positive sentiment due to its emphasis on good intentions despite some flaws.\n\n3", 3, 2, 27.93187426700024], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user has provided a sentence: \"a funny and well-constructed black comedy where the old adage 'be careful what you wish for' is given a full workout.\" They want me to classify this as 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), or 4 (very positive).\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. The words \"funny\" and \"well-constructed\" are both positive adjectives. \"Funny\" obviously relates to humor, which is a positive aspect. \"Well-constructed\" suggests that the work is well-made or thought out, another positive point.\n\nThe phrase \"black comedy\" refers to a genre that often deals with dark themes in a humorous way. While black comedies can touch on serious or uncomfortable topics, the mention of it being funny and well-constructed leans towards a positive sentiment rather than negative, because the focus is on the humor and execution rather than the dark content.\n\nThe adage \"be careful what you wish for\" implies that sometimes desires have unintended consequences. In this context, though, it's mentioned in a way that seems to highlight how the comedy explores this theme thoroughly (\"given a full workout\"). This doesn't necessarily add negativity; instead, it suggests depth and thoroughness, which are positive attributes.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence is highlighting positive aspects: humor, construction quality, and thematic depth. There's no negative language here. Therefore, the sentiment should be positive. Now, considering the scale: 0-4 with 4 being very positive. Since there are two clear positive descriptors and no negatives, I think it's a strong positive but not necessarily the highest possible. Maybe 3 (positive) or perhaps even 4 if \"very positive.\" But given that while it's definitely positive, it might not be extremely so without more superlatives.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment of the text is positive due to words like \"funny\" and \"well-constructed,\" highlighting humor and quality. \n\n3", 3, 4, 41.55656097701285], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is: \"downright transparent is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' pg-13 rating.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the adjectives and phrases used. The word \"downright\" adds intensity here, meaning something is clearly or obviously bad. \"Transparent\" suggests that something is obvious in a negative way, perhaps insincere or lacking subtlety.\n\nNext, there's an \"endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes.\" \"Endless assault\" indicates a lot of something, and \"embarrassingly ham-fisted\" implies that the jokes are poorly done to the point of being awkward or embarrassing. The word \"jokes\" here seems to carry a negative connotation because they're described as bad.\n\nThe phrase \"reeks of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a 'cooler' pg-13 rating.\" uses \"reeks,\" which means something smells bad, metaphorically implying that the changes are obvious and perhaps insincere. The goal is to make the film seem cooler with a PG-13 rating, but this approach comes off as forced or desperate.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment expressed is clearly negative. The text criticizes the script for using poor, embarrassing jokes and making an insincere attempt to appeal to a broader audience with a rating change. There's no positive language here; everything points towards frustration or disappointment with how the film was handled.\n\nSo, on the scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive), this should be classified as either 0 or 1. Since it's quite harsh in its criticism but not overly extreme beyond just being very negative, I think 1 would be appropriate because it's clearly negative without being excessively so. However, considering the strong language like \"endless assault\" and \"reeks,\" maybe it's closer to 0 for very negative. But perhaps the user considers 1 as negative enough here.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is strongly negative due to harsh criticism of the script's elements and insincere changes. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 0, 50.386103204014944], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts by talking about a \"simple tale of an unlikely friendship,\" which sounds pretty straightforward but not necessarily positive or negative on its own. Then it uses the word \"but,\" which often indicates a contrast. The rest of the sentence is quite positive: \"gorgeous locales\" and \"exceptional lead performances.\" These phrases are strong positives because \"gorgeous\" and \"exceptional\" are both very complimentary.\n\nThe last part mentions that the story has \"considerable charm,\" which again is a positive statement. So, even though it begins by mentioning something simple, the latter part with \"but\" flips the sentiment to positive. The overall tone seems to be appreciative of the film or story's elements.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. Even the initial mention of an unlikely friendship isn't necessarily negative; it could just be an interesting premise. So putting it all together, the sentiment is clearly positive. Now, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit. 1 is negative, also not fitting since there are no negatives here. Neutral (2) might be a thought, but given the strong positives in \"gorgeous,\" \"exceptional,\" and \"considerable charm,\" it's more than neutral. So that leaves positive (3) or very positive (4). \n\n\"Exceptional\" is quite a strong word, as is \"gorgeous.\" These are high compliments, so maybe 4? But the first part was just setting up without negatives. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps 3 because while it's all positive, it's not superlatives beyond that.\n\nWait, but the text says it has \"considerable charm,\" which is pretty strong. So maybe 4. Or does \"a simple tale\" imply that it's not overly complex, which might be neutral? But no, the context here doesn't make it seem negative; instead, it's a compliment on how well the simplicity works with the other elements.\n\nSo I think the sentiment is very positive because of the use of strong adjectives. So 4 would be appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses strong positive adjectives like \"gorgeous,\" \"exceptional,\" and mentions \"considerable charm,\" indicating a very positive sentiment.\n\n4", 4, 4, 54.83590258299955], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is: \"the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the words used. The adjective \"exploitative\" has a negative connotation because it implies taking advantage in a way that's unfair. Then, \"clumsily staged violence\" suggests that the violence was poorly executed or awkwardly presented, which is also negative.\n\nThe phrase \"overshadows everything\" indicates that this aspect dominates the entire context, making other elements (like the actors) less significant. The use of \"including most of the actors\" implies that even their performances are overshadowed by the negative aspects mentioned earlier.\n\nPutting it all together, the text describes a situation where violence is not only present but also poorly handled, which negatively impacts the overall experience. There's no positive language here; everything points towards dissatisfaction or criticism.\n\nSo, considering these elements, the sentiment expressed is strongly negative. On the scale provided, 0 represents very negative, so that should be the classification.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses strong negative adjectives like \"exploitative\" and describes the violence as \"clumsily staged,\" which negatively impacts everything else mentioned.

So the sentiment here is leaning towards positive. The phrase \"more enjoyable than I expected\" suggests that it exceeded expectations, adding to the positivity.\n\nHowever, there's also the part about \"fairly basic comedic constructs.\" This could be interpreted in a couple of ways. On one hand, it might mean that the humor was simple and relatable, which can still be positive if the audience found it funny. On the other hand, \"basic\" might imply that it wasn't very sophisticated or original, which some people could see as a negative.\n\nPutting this together, the overall sentiment seems positive because of the use of \"enjoyable.\" The mention of basic constructs doesn't completely negate the positivity but slightly tempers it. So, I think it's more on the positive side but not extremely so. That would place it at 3 (positive) rather than 4 (very positive).\n\nI don't see any strongly negative words, just a slight acknowledgment that the humor isn't complex. Therefore, my classification is 3.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence expresses a positive sentiment due to the use of \"enjoyable\" and exceeding expectations, despite noting simple humor. \n\nAnswer: 3", 3, 3, 34.73628772300435], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It's described as \"swinging from one approach to the other,\" implying instability or lack of focus. That sounds negative.\n\nThen it mentions that despite these changes, it ends up following a formula. Using \"formula\" suggests predictability and maybe being unoriginal, which isn't positive either.\n\nThe phrase \"which is a waste of de niro, mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast\" directly criticizes how the movie underuses its talented actors. This shows dissatisfaction because the potential wasn't met.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment is clearly negative. There are no neutral or positive elements here. So, considering the scale where 0 is very negative, I think this would be a 1 (negative) rather than 0 because while it's negative, it doesn't seem extremely harsh\u2014it's more about underutilization and formulaic approach without stronger negative language.\n</think>\n\nThe text criticizes the movie for inconsistency and predictability, wasting good actors.

The text is: \"they 're just a couple of cops in copmovieland , these two , but in narc , they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood .\"\n\nFirst, I'll break it down. It starts by saying they're just a couple of cops in \"copmovieland.\" That term sounds a bit dismissive or maybe a play on words. Maybe implying that their roles are typical or clich\u00e9d. But then the second part says, \"but in narc, they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood.\" The word \"new\" suggests something positive, like innovation or fresh approaches. \"Familiar neighborhood\" might mean they're dealing with known settings but finding new ways.\n\nPutting it together, the first part is slightly negative or neutral because of \"just a couple of cops,\" which could be underwhelming. But then the second part adds a positive twist by talking about new routes and innovation. The overall sentiment seems balanced but leans towards positive because of the emphasis on new approaches despite being in a familiar setting.\n\nSo I think it's more positive than negative.

The sentence is: \"nijinsky says, 'i know how to suffer' and if you see this film you'll know too.\" So first, I need to understand what each part means.\n\nThe phrase \"'i know how to suffer'\" suggests that Nijinsky has a lot of experience with suffering. That sounds pretty negative because suffering is typically associated with pain or hardship. But the second part says, \"if you see this film you'll know too.\" This could mean that watching the film will make someone understand what it's like to suffer.\n\nNow, I need to consider the overall sentiment. The first part is definitely negative because of the word \"suffer.\" The second part might be encouraging people to watch the film to empathize, but without knowing more about the context or the tone of the film, it's hard to tell if that adds a positive spin.\n\nIs the person recommending the film in a positive light? Or are they just stating a fact about its content? If the film is about suffering and the reviewer wants others to know that too, maybe there's an undercurrent of positivity because it might be enlightening or thought-provoking. But without explicit positive words like \"great,\" \"amazing,\" or \"moving,\" it's a bit tricky.\n\nI'm leaning towards neutral because while the mention of suffering is negative, the overall statement doesn't express a strong emotion either way. It's informative rather than emotionally charged.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each word individually. The first word is \"fun.\" That's clearly positive because having fun is something people enjoy. It gives a sense of happiness or enjoyment.\n\nNext is \"nimble.\" Nimble means quick and light in movement or thinking. While it's not explicitly positive like \"fun,\" it has a positive connotation because being nimble implies agility, efficiency, and grace, which are generally good traits. So, both words have positive meanings.\n\nNow, putting them together: \"fun and nimble.\" The combination suggests something that is enjoyable and also effective or quick. This makes the overall sentiment quite positive. Since both descriptors are favorable, there's no negative aspect here to bring it down.\n\nI should consider if there's any ambiguity or sarcasm, but since the context isn't provided, I have to take these words at face value.

The user has specified that the output must be an integer between 0 and 4, with each number representing varying degrees of negative or positive sentiment. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the provided text carefully: \"when cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy giannini , madonna gives her best performance since abel ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game.\" My task is to classify how negative or positive this sentiment is.\n\nLooking at the words used, \"cowering\" and \"begging\" are strong verbs that suggest a vulnerable situation. These could imply a negative context. However, the phrase \"gives her best performance since Abel Ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game\" seems to be highlighting Madonna's acting skills. The mention of her giving her best performance is positive.\n\nI need to consider if \"scruffy Giannini\" adds any negativity. While \"scruffy\" might have negative connotations, it's describing someone else (Giannini) rather than Madonna. So, the focus remains on Madonna's performance being lauded.\n\nPutting this together, the text seems to be praising Madonna for her acting in a challenging role. The mention of her previous experience where she was beaten is likely highlighting the intensity and realism of her performance. Therefore, despite some negative descriptors, the overall sentiment leans positive because it's about her commendable acting work.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 4 is very positive. Since there are both elements that could be seen as negative (begging, beaten) but the context is about a positive achievement in acting, I think the sentiment is more on the positive side. It's not extremely positive because it's more of an acknowledgment than effusive praise, so maybe a 3.\n\nI should also make sure there's no sarcasm or hidden negativity here. The text doesn't seem sarcastic; it's a genuine critique pointing out her strong performance despite tough circumstances. So, yeah, I'm confident it's positive but not the highest possible score.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 4, 46.0050389310054], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts with \"pretty much sucks,\" which is clearly a strong negative statement. Using the word \"sucks\" definitely conveys dissatisfaction or dislike. That part alone might lean towards a lower score, maybe a 0 or 1.\n\nBut then the sentence continues: \"but has a funny moment or two.\" The use of \"but\" indicates a contrast to the previous negative statement. Here, the user is mentioning that despite the overall negativity, there were some positive aspects\u2014specifically, funny moments. So this adds a positive element, which might balance out the score.\n\nNow I need to weigh these parts. The first part is strong and negative, while the second part is less intense but still positive. How do these two parts affect the sentiment? Since \"sucks\" is quite strong, it might dominate, but the presence of funny moments suggests that there's some positivity to consider.\n\nSo on a scale from 0 to 4: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. The text isn't entirely negative because of the funny moments, so it can't be a 0 or 1. It's not neutral either because the negative part is stronger than just neutrality.\n\nConsidering that there are some positives mentioned, but they don't outweigh the negativity, maybe a score of 2 (neutral) would be appropriate. Alternatively, since the positive aspect exists but isn't strong enough to tip it into being positive, neutral seems like the right call.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment is classified as 2, which is neutral because while there's negativity from \"sucks,\" the mention of funny moments introduces a positive element that doesn't overpower the negative.\n\nAnswer: 2", 2, 1, 43.44703521498013], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user wants a number from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive. Let me read the sentence again: \"In his role as an observer of the scene, Lawrence sounds whiny and defensive, as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature.\"\n\nOkay, breaking this down. The text describes Lawrence in a certain way. Words like \"whiny\" and \"defensive\" are used. Those words have negative connotations. Whiny suggests he's complaining or being annoying, while defensive implies he might be protective or resistant, which isn't necessarily positive.\n\nThen it says his experiences made him \"bitter\" and \"less mature.\" Bitter is definitely a negative term, indicating resentment or unhappiness. Less mature also carries a negative implication because maturity is generally seen as a positive trait, so being less of that suggests underdevelopment or immaturity.\n\nSo putting this all together, the sentiment seems clearly negative. Now, I need to decide how negative it is on the scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). The sentence uses multiple negative adjectives: whiny, defensive, bitter, and less mature. Each of these adds to a strongly negative portrayal of Lawrence.\n\nI don't see any positive words here. It's all about his shortcomings or negative traits. So this should be on the lower end of the scale. Is it 0 (very negative) or maybe 1? The user mentioned 0 is very negative, so given that there are multiple strong negative descriptors, I think 0 is appropriate because it conveys a strong negativity.\n\nI don't think it's neutral because all the words used are clearly negative. It's not just slightly negative but uses terms that show Lawrence in an unfavorable light. Therefore, the sentiment is very negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses several negative adjectives to describe Lawrence, indicating a strongly negative sentiment.\n\n0", 0, 1, 41.45876952202525], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Then there's \"without sham,\" which means genuine and sincere\u2014another positive point. The phrase \"raw-nerved story\" suggests that the story is intense or emotional, which can be seen as a compliment to the cast's performance.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence seems to praise both the cast and the story. They're not just going through the motions; they're doing it authentically and emotionally. So I think this is a positive sentiment. On the scale given, that would probably be a 3 or 4. Since \"without sham\" adds more strength to the positivity, maybe leaning towards a 4 for very positive.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence praises both the cast's performance and the authenticity of the story, indicating a strong positive sentiment.\n\n4", 4, 3, 19.19236048401217], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the text is \"consistently clever and suspenseful.\" Okay, let's look at each word. \"Consistently\" means something happens all the time or regularly, so it's a modifier here. It's not negative on its own. Then we have \"clever,\" which is definitely positive. Clever implies intelligence, creativity, something done well.\n\nNext up is \"and suspenseful.\" Suspenseful can be tricky because it depends on context. In some cases, suspense might evoke anxiety or tension, but in the context of a story or movie review, suspenseful usually means engaging and thrilling, which is positive. So combining that with clever makes me think this is a compliment.\n\nPutting it all together, \"consistently clever\" suggests that whatever is being talked about is consistently good in its cleverness. Adding \"suspenseful\" enhances the positive sentiment by implying that it's also exciting or intriguing. There are no negative words here; everything points towards a favorable view.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. Since both adjectives used are clearly positive and there's nothing neutral or negative mentioned, this should be on the higher end of positivity. It's not just a little positive; it's consistently clever and suspenseful, which makes me lean towards a 3 or 4.\n\nI might think about whether \"consistently\" adds extra positivity. If something is consistently good, that's a strong endorsement. So, putting it all together, I think this text is very positive. Therefore, the sentiment classification should be 4.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses positive adjectives like \"clever\" and \"suspenseful,\" indicating a favorable view. \n\n4", 4, 4, 39.50572037001257], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Hmm, let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the sentence structure. It starts with \"You won't look... the same way again,\" which suggests a change in perception. The phrase after that lists two things: religious fanatics and backyard sheds. Now, I have to consider what each of these evokes.\n\nReligious fanatics are often associated with negative connotations because they can be seen as extreme or even dangerous. So mentioning them could imply the sentence is pointing out something concerning or unsettling about them. On the other hand, backyard sheds are usually neutral; they're just structures where people keep tools or things. But putting them together in this context might mean that both of these things are being viewed differently now.\n\nThe word \"fanatics\" definitely carries a negative tone, so that's leaning towards a negative sentiment. However, since the sentence is making an observation rather than expressing strong emotion, it doesn't seem extremely negative. Also, backyard sheds don't add much to the negativity; they're just part of the comparison.\n\nSo putting it all together: the main point is about changing how someone looks at religious fanatics and backyard sheds. The mention of fanatics suggests a negative aspect, but because it's not using strong language beyond \"fanatics,\" it doesn't feel very negative. Therefore, I think the sentiment here is negative but not extremely so. That would correspond to 1 on the scale.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 2, 34.30265629000496], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts with \"you should pay nine bucks for this,\" which seems a bit neutral or slightly negative because it's about spending money. Then it explains why: because you can hear about suffering Afghan refugees on the news and still be unaffected.\n\nThe key part here is the explanation. The person is pointing out that despite hearing about the suffering of Afghan refugees, someone remains unaffected. This implies criticism or disappointment towards people who don't care or take action regarding this issue. So the sentiment isn't positive; it's more negative because it's highlighting a lack of empathy.\n\nBut how negative is it? On a scale from 0 to 4, with 0 being very negative and 4 very positive, I need to decide where this falls. The statement doesn't use strong negative words like \"terrible\" or \"disgusting,\" but the criticism suggests a negative sentiment. It's not extremely negative either; it's more of a mild criticism.\n\nSo considering that, maybe it's a 1 (negative). However, sometimes people might see it as neutral because it's just stating an observation without strong emotions. But given the context about being unaffected despite hearing about suffering, I think there's enough negativity to classify it as negative rather than neutral.\n\nTherefore, I would assign this sentiment a 1.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a mild criticism towards apathy regarding Afghan refugees' suffering, indicating a negative sentiment but not extremely so.\n\n1", 1, 2, 37.092262321995804], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The words used are positive\u2014like \"best-sustained\" and \"one of the best.\" That makes me think the sentiment is definitely positive.\n\nI should consider the structure too. They're comparing it to others, which suggests a high opinion. Also, using superlatives like \"best\" usually indicates strong positive feelings. There's no negative language here, so I don't think it's neutral or negative.\n\nBut wait, sometimes people use \"apart from anything else\" as a way to downplay other things before giving a compliment. However, in this case, the focus is clearly on praising the idea, so that doesn't make it less positive.\n\nSo putting it all together, I think the sentiment here is very positive.

The phrase \"It's a hoot\" catches my attention. I know that \"hoot\" is slang for something funny or amusing. So right away, this seems positive.\n\nNext, looking at the actions described: watching someone (The Rock) chomp on jumbo ants, pull an arrow out of his back, and leap through fire unharmed. These are all pretty intense and dramatic scenarios. The use of \"jumbo ants\" suggests they're big or maybe comically large, which adds to the humor. Pulling an arrow from the back sounds like something you'd see in action movies, but combined with leaping through fire, it's a bit over-the-top.\n\nThe word \"unscathed\" means he wasn't hurt at all, which is impressive and might be surprising or entertaining. The exclamation mark at the end also adds to the excitement and positive tone.\n\nPutting it all together: the sentence uses humor (\"hoot\"), describes exciting and dramatic actions, and ends with an exclamation point.

It compares something to \"a cartoon\" but notes that it resembles it more than \"The Simpsons ever has.\" The user is saying that whatever they're talking about looks more like a typical cartoon compared to The Simpsons. \n\nNow, considering that The Simpsons is known for its distinctive animation style and humor, comparing something else to being \"more like a cartoon\" could imply different things. If the context suggests that this comparison is positive, it might mean the subject has vibrant or engaging animation. However, if it's meant negatively, it could imply that it lacks the unique qualities of The Simpsons, perhaps seeming more generic.\n\nLooking at the wording, the sentence uses \"much more like a cartoon,\" which doesn't inherently carry a strong positive or negative connotation. It's more about comparison without explicit sentiment words. Without additional context, it's neutral because there's no clear indication of positivity or negativity.\n\nSo, I should classify this as neutral, which is 2.\n</think>\n\nThe statement compares the subject to a typical cartoon but doesn't express a strong positive or negative emotion.

The main word here is \"interesting,\" which generally has a neutral connotation but can sometimes lean positive depending on context. However, it's not strongly positive; it just states that something captures attention or is engaging.\n\nThen there are two descriptors: \"as a historical study\" and \"as a tragic love story.\" Historical study doesn't have an emotional charge\u2014it's more factual. Tragic love story does have some emotional weight, but the word \"tragic\" usually has a negative connotation because it implies sadness or misfortune. However, in the context of a story, it might be viewed as compelling rather than outright negative.\n\nPutting this together: The text is pointing out that the subject is interesting both historically and as a tragic love story. It doesn't express overtly positive emotions like joy or enthusiasm, nor does it express strong negative feelings beyond the tragedy aspect. Since \"interesting\" can be seen as slightly favorable but not strongly so, I think the sentiment here is neutral.\n\nSo, assigning this to one of the categories: 0 for very negative seems too low because there's no strong negativity. 1 might still be a bit negative, but since it's more about being interesting and a tragic story without explicit negative language, 2 (neutral) fits best.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is neutral.\n\nAnswer: 2", 2, 3, 32.114954896998825], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user provided a sentence about Claude Chabrol's camera work. Let me read it again: \"claude chabrol 's camera has a way of gently swaying back and forth as it cradles its characters , veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the words to understand their connotations. The sentence starts by mentioning Claude Chabrol's camera technique. It says the camera \"gently sways back and forth,\" which sounds calm and deliberate. The word \"cradles\" is used for the characters, which gives a sense of comfort or protection, like how you'd cradle something delicate.\n\nThen it talks about \"veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements.\" So there's tension but it's hidden under tenderness. This might indicate an underlying complexity in the scene\u2014the director isn't being straightforward, adding depth to the emotions portrayed.\n\nLooking at the adjectives: \"gently\" and \"tender\" are both positive or neutral terms. They suggest a softness and care in how the camera is used. The mention of tension could be negative if it's something bad, but since it's veiled under tenderness, maybe it adds intrigue rather than negativity.\n\nPutting this all together, the description seems to appreciate the director's technique for creating an atmosphere that combines subtlety with emotional depth. It doesn't express any overtly positive or negative emotions but highlights a nuanced approach, which leans more towards positive in terms of artistry and skill.\n\nI should consider if there are any negative words. \"Veiling tension\" might suggest some underlying issues, but it's presented as part of the director's style rather than a flaw. So overall, the sentiment is favorable towards Chabrol's work without being extremely effusive.\n\nSo, on a scale from 0 to 4, I'd say this is positive but not very positive. Maybe a 3.\n</think>\n\nThe text describes Claude Chabrol's camera technique with appreciation for its subtlety and emotional depth, using terms like \"gently\" and \"tender.\" The mention of veiled tension adds complexity without indicating negativity.\n\n3", 3, 3, 42.33818000499741], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the sentence: \"Sadly, Full Frontal plays like the work of a dilettante.\" \n\nThe word \"sadly\" immediately sets a negative tone. It indicates disappointment or regret about something. Next, the phrase \"plays like the work of a dilettante.\" The term \"dilettante\" refers to someone who is not serious or skilled in an art or science; they are more of an amateur. So calling something a dilettante's work suggests it lacks depth and seriousness.\n\nPutting these together, the speaker is expressing disappointment with \"Full Frontal,\" implying that it doesn't meet expected standards. The sentiment here isn't extremely negative, but it's definitely on the lower end.\n\nNow, considering the scale:\n- 0: Very Negative\n- 1: Negative\n- 2: Neutral\n- 3: Positive\n- 4: Very Positive\n\nSince the statement is clearly negative but not using harsher language like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" it doesn't reach a 0.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the positive aspects: \"a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film.\" The word \"energetic\" suggests something lively and exciting, which is positive. \"Enliven\" means to make more interesting or lively, so that's a plus.\n\nNow, moving on to the negative parts. The text mentions a \"wheezing terrorist subplot.\" \"Wheezing\" implies that the subplot isn't strong or effective\u2014it might be weak or struggling. Then it says this subplot doesn't have the stamina for the 100-minute runtime. That suggests the plot is underdeveloped and can't sustain interest throughout the film, which is a negative point.\n\nThe last part talks about the protagonists' \"bohemian boorishness.\" \"Boorishness\" refers to being rude or insensitive, so it's not a positive trait. This quality mars the spirit of good clean fun, meaning it ruins what could have been an enjoyable aspect of the movie.\n\nPutting it all together: The film has some positive elements with energetic stunts but is weighed down by weak storytelling and unappealing characters. The positives are outweighed by the negatives. \n\nI think this sentiment leans more towards negative than positive. Since 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, and so on up to 4 for very positive, I need to decide where this falls. The text isn't entirely harsh but does highlight significant flaws that detract from the overall experience. So, it's not extremely negative but still leans towards being more on the negative side.

The phrase \"judging by those standards\" sets up a comparison or evaluation based on certain criteria. Then comes \"'Scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary.\" \n\nThe key words here are \"pretty decent,\" which isn't super strong but is definitely positive. \"Decent\" usually means something is good enough, not bad. Adding \"pretty\" as an intensifier makes it slightly more positive than just \"decent.\" Also, calling it a \"little documentary\" might seem neutral or even slightly negative if implying smallness, but in this context, it seems affectionate rather than dismissive.\n\nSo putting it all together, the speaker is saying that based on some standards, 'Scratch' is pretty good. It's not a glowing review with superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"excellent,\" but it's definitely positive. \n\nTherefore, I think this sentiment is more than neutral (2) but not extremely positive (4).

The words \"lovely\" and \"amazing\" are clearly positive terms. They usually indicate a happy or favorable sentiment. So that part is definitely leaning towards positive.\n\nBut then there's a shift with the word \"unhappily.\" This suggests some negative emotion, maybe dissatisfaction or sorrow. It's not extremely strong, but it does introduce a negative aspect into the text.\n\nThe phrase \"is neither ... excessively strained and contrived\" seems to be saying that something is not overly forced or unnatural. The use of \"excessively\" might imply that while there was some strain, it wasn't extreme. So this part could be seen as slightly negative because being strained isn't positive, but the word \"neither\" suggests a middle ground\u2014it's not too bad.\n\nPutting it all together: There are clear positive words at the beginning and a mix of negative terms later on. The overall sentiment doesn't seem extremely negative or positive. It has elements from both sides, so I'm leaning towards neutral.\n\nI should make sure I'm not overcomplicating this.

It's adequate rather than outstanding.\n\nConsidering the context, this is about a movie or show aimed at families. The phrase doesn't express strong positive emotions like excitement or joy, nor does it indicate any negative feelings. Instead, it's a neutral assessment\u2014something that serves its purpose without being particularly outstanding.\n\nSo, combining these observations, the sentiment isn't very positive (4) because there's no enthusiasm.

Yeah, I think so because it conveys struggle and failure.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, up to 4 which is very positive. This doesn't seem extremely negative like a complete disaster (which might be a 0), but it's definitely not neutral or positive. So I'm leaning towards 1 for negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a sense of frustration and failure, indicating negativity without being extreme.\n\n1", 1, 0, 21.135254216002068], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence is: \"a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down each part of the sentence to understand the emotions conveyed.\n\nStarting with \"cinematic disaster.\" That sounds very negative. When someone calls a movie a disaster, they're clearly dissatisfied or upset about it. So that's a strong negative point.\n\nNext, \"so inadvertently sidesplitting.\" Sidesplitting usually means something is extremely funny, so this part seems positive. But the word \"inadvertently\" suggests that the humor was unintended. Maybe the movie wasn't supposed to be funny but ended up being so in a way that's amusingly bad.\n\nPutting those together: The movie is a disaster (bad) but also inadvertently hilarious (good). So there are both negative and positive elements here.\n\nThen, \"it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone.\" This means despite its flaws, it's entertaining enough to watch because you can laugh at how bad it is. That seems like a slightly positive take because they think it's worth watching, even if just for the laughs.\n\nSo overall, the sentiment isn't entirely negative or positive. It's a mix where the movie is criticized as a disaster but also praised for its unintended humor. However, the mention of being a disaster leans more towards the negative side, while the worthiness due to the ridicule factor adds positivity.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The statement has both negative and positive aspects but seems closer to negative because it's called a disaster, even if there's some redeeming value in its absurdity.\n\nTherefore, I think this sentiment would be classified as 1 (negative), since the primary emotion expressed is disappointment with an acknowledgment of some unintended humor that doesn't outweigh the negative assessment.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a mixed sentiment but leans towards negative due to labeling the movie as a disaster, despite acknowledging unintended humor.

The text is: \"largely, this is a movie that also does it by the numbers.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They want me to determine whether this sentence has a very negative (0), negative (1), neutral (2), positive (3), or very positive (4) sentiment.\n\nLooking at the phrase \"does it by the numbers,\" that usually means something is formulaic or follows a standard approach without much creativity. In movies, when people say it's done \"by the numbers,\" they often mean it's predictable and lacks originality. That can be seen as a negative trait because it suggests the movie isn't innovative or engaging beyond typical expectations.\n\nSo, considering that, I might lean towards a negative sentiment. But is it very negative? Probably not. It's more of a criticism but not overly harsh. So maybe a 1 for negative.\n\nWait, let me think again. The sentence starts with \"largely,\" which could imply that while the movie does follow formulas, there might be some exceptions or positive aspects too. That softens the negativity a bit. Maybe it's not entirely bad but just somewhat predictable.\n\nHmm, so is it neutral? Neutral would mean no strong positive or negative feelings. But I think the mention of \"by the numbers\" leans towards a criticism, hence negative. However, since it's not extremely harsh, maybe 1 instead of 0.\n\nAlternatively, if someone says a movie does things by the numbers, they might be saying it's reliable but unoriginal. That could still be neutral because it's just stating a fact without strong emotion. But I think there's an implicit criticism here, so negative is more appropriate.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the sentiment is negative, which would be 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence suggests the movie follows predictable formulas, indicating a somewhat negative tone. However, it's not overly harsh, leading to a classification of 1.\n\n**Answer:** 1", 1, 2, 40.374572408007225], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user wants me to classify it on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive. Let's break down the text.\n\nThe first part says \"Godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess.\" Here, they're talking about Godard's work. The words used are \"rambling,\" which means it lacks structure or coherence, \"incoherent\" meaning unclear or not making sense, and \"vagueness of topical excess\" suggests that the topics are too broad or not focused. So this is negative.\n\nThen the second part says \"In praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating.\" Here, \"ponderous\" means heavy and serious in a way that's boring, \"pretentious\" suggests it's trying too hard to be important or intellectual, \"unfocused\" again points to lack of direction, and \"tediously exasperating\" is very negative\u2014something that causes frustration and boredom.\n\nPutting it all together, the text uses several negative adjectives: rambling, incoherent, ponderous, pretentious, unfocused, tediously exasperating. There are no positive words mentioned about the work. All descriptors are critical, highlighting issues with clarity, focus, and overall execution.\n\nSo, considering that all these terms are negative and there's nothing positive here, I should classify this as very negative. That corresponds to 0 on the scale.\n</think>\n\n0", 0, 0, 35.10484174999874], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is about Scooby-Doo and its uncertainty in direction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the sentiment expressed here. The phrase \"doesn't know if it wants to be\" suggests confusion or indecision. This could imply that the movie isn't clearly targeting a specific audience, which might make viewers feel uncertain about its appeal.\n\nNext, terms like \"retro-refitting exercise in campy recall\" and \"silly, nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick\" describe two different directions. The former targets older fans with nostalgia, while the latter is for children. The uncertainty between these approaches can be seen as a negative because it may lead to a disjointed or unsatisfying experience for either audience.\n\nConsidering the sentiment scale: 0 is very negative, and 4 is very positive. Since the text points out confusion without clear positivity, it's not neutral (2) but leans towards negative. However, it's not extremely harsh, so maybe not as low as 0 or 1.\n\nI'm thinking the sentiment is slightly negative because of the uncertainty expressed, which might disappoint fans expecting a specific type of movie. Therefore, classifying it as 1 (negative) seems appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a neutral to slightly negative sentiment due to its uncertainty and criticism about the direction of Scooby-Doo.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 30.586463381012436], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user gave me some guidelines too, saying that I should output only one integer between 0 and 4, with 0 being very negative and 4 very positive.\n\nFirst, let's read the text again: \"enjoyably dumb , sweet , and intermittently hilarious -- if you 've a taste for the quirky , steal a glimpse .\" Okay, so the words used here are \"enjoyably dumb,\" \"sweet,\" and \"intermittently hilarious.\" Then it says something about stealing a glimpse if you like quirky things.\n\nHmm, breaking this down. \"Enjoyably dumb\" \u2013 that's interesting because \"dumb\" can sometimes be negative, but when paired with \"enjoyably,\" it becomes more positive. It suggests that despite being simple or silly, it's enjoyable. So I think that's a positive point.\n\nNext word is \"sweet.\" That's definitely positive. Sweet usually conveys something pleasant or endearing.\n\nThen we have \"intermittently hilarious.\" \"Hilarious\" is clearly positive, and even though it's intermittent, the fact that there are funny parts makes it a plus.\n\nPutting those together: enjoyably dumb (positive), sweet (positive), intermittently hilarious (positive). So all these descriptors lean towards positive sentiment. \n\nThe ending part says, \"if you've a taste for the quirky, steal a glimpse.\" That seems like a recommendation or an invitation to check it out if someone likes quirky things. So that's another hint towards a positive sentiment.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. Words like \"dumb\" could sometimes be negative, but in this context, combined with \"enjoyably,\" it's more about being enjoyably simple rather than a criticism.\n\nSo considering all these positive adjectives and the encouraging tone at the end, I think the sentiment is quite positive. Now, how does that translate to the scale? 0 is very negative, so definitely not that. 1 is negative, which also doesn't fit. Neutral would be 2, but this seems more than neutral because of the positive words. Then we have 3 as positive and 4 as very positive.\n\nThe adjectives used are strong positives: \"hilarious,\" \"sweet,\" and \"enjoyably dumb\" \u2013 all contributing to a very positive vibe. So I think it's leaning towards 4, which is very positive.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 3, 48.56914180700551], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase \"unfolds with such a wallop\" \u2013 wallops are strong hits, so this suggests something impactful. \"You-are-there immediacy\" makes me think of being immersed in a situation, like a movie or a book where you feel like you're right there in the action.\n\nThen it says \"when the bullets start to fly.\" That's a violent image, which could be negative. But the reaction is \"your first instinct is to duck,\" implying that the experience is so intense and realistic that you physically react as if you were in danger. \n\nSo the sentiment isn't negative because it's not expressing sadness or anger. It's more about the intensity of the experience. The way it's described sounds positive because it highlights a strong, engaging feeling, making the reader feel involved.\n\nPutting it all together, I think this is a very positive sentiment because it conveys an exciting and immersive experience.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 4, 27.41370126401307], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase \"go ape\" is slang for becoming extremely excited or enthusiastic about something. So when someone asks if you'll go ape over a movie, they're essentially asking if you'll love it or be really into it.\n\nThe structure of the question suggests excitement. It\u2019s phrased in a way that's trying to gauge a strong positive reaction. There are no negative words here; instead, it's all about potential enthusiasm.\n\nConsidering the options:\n- 0 and 1 would indicate negativity, which doesn't fit since there's nothing negative in the text.\n- 2 is neutral, but the question implies an expectation of a positive response, so neutral might be too tame.\n- 3 (positive) seems more accurate because it's about expecting someone to have a positive reaction.\n- 4 is very positive, which could also fit since \"go ape\" suggests a high level of excitement.\n\nHowever, since the text is phrased as a question and not a direct statement of how great the movie is, it's slightly less intense than a straight endorsement. Therefore, it leans more towards a strong positive rather than extremely so.\n\nSo, I think 3 (positive) is the best fit here.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in \"Will you go ape over this movie?\" is positive because it implies excitement and enthusiasm about the film.

The text mentions it's \"quaint,\" which usually has a positive or at least neutral connotation. It talks about mending a child's pain for his dead mother through communication with an old woman. That sounds like a touching and heartwarming interaction, so that leans towards positive.\n\nThe comparison to Eudora Welty makes me think of her style, which is often warm and insightful, dealing with human emotions in a sensitive way. So putting it all together, the story seems to have a positive sentiment because it's about healing and connection, even though there's some sadness involved with the mother's death.

The given text is: \"too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize, and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentences. The first part mentions \"too many scenarios\" where the hero gets to triumphantly sermonize. The word \"triumphantly\" suggests a positive outcome or success, but \"sermonize\" might imply a bit of preaching or overexplanation, which could be seen as negative because it takes away from the audience's experience.\n\nThe second part says there are \"too few\" scenarios where we can wonder if things will turn out okay. This indicates a lack of opportunities for suspense or uncertainty, which is usually considered positive in storytelling because it keeps readers engaged and invested.\n\nSo, the first sentence points towards a negative aspect\u2014there's an overemphasis on the hero's triumphs that might be too much\u2014and the second part also points negative because there aren't enough moments where the outcome isn't certain. Both parts seem to express dissatisfaction with the balance of scenarios in whatever context we're talking about (maybe a book, movie, or story).\n\nThe overall sentiment seems negative because it's pointing out an imbalance that affects the experience negatively. It's not extremely negative but leans more towards a negative sentiment.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, which might be too strong here since the text isn't overly harsh. 1 is negative, which fits because there are clear criticisms about the scenarios. The other options (neutral, positive) don't fit because the text is expressing dissatisfaction.

That makes me think the overall sentiment is positive. Now, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The text isn't extremely positive; it's more of a mild recommendation. So maybe a 3 would be appropriate here.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not overcomplicating this. Sometimes, people might use \"entertaining enough\" as a softer way of saying something is good but not great. But in context, the speaker isn't dismissing it entirely; they're just comparing it to other genres and then affirming its value. So yes, positive but perhaps not the highest on the scale.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 2, 34.956252555013634], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence starts by talking about \"kwan\" and describes them as a master of \"shadow,\" \"quietude,\" and \"room noise.\" These terms sound artistic and somewhat technical, which makes me think that this is a compliment or at least a neutral observation.\n\nNext, it mentions \"lan yu\" being \"a disarmingly lived-in movie.\" The word \"disarmingly\" suggests something positive, perhaps indicating that the film is unexpectedly charming. \"Lived-in\" could mean that the movie feels authentic and well-developed, which is usually seen as a good quality in films.\n\nPutting it all together, both parts of the sentence seem to be expressing appreciation or admiration for the works mentioned. There are no negative words here; instead, the language used implies praise. However, since there aren't superlatives like \"excellent\" or \"amazing,\" the sentiment isn't extremely positive but still leans towards being positive.\n\nI should also consider if any parts of the sentence might be ambiguous or could have a different connotation. Words like \"shadow\" and \"quietude\" can sometimes imply something mysterious, which in certain contexts could be negative. However, given that they're preceded by \"master,\" it's more likely to highlight skill rather than any negative aspects.\n\nTherefore, weighing all these elements, the sentiment expressed is positive but not overly so. It doesn't reach the level of 4 (very positive) because there's no use of strong adjectives or enthusiastic language. Instead, it falls into the category of 3 (positive).\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses appreciation and admiration for Kwan and Lan Yu, using positive descriptors like \"master\" and \"disarmingly lived-in.\" There are no negative elements, so the sentiment is positive.\n\n3", 3, 3, 45.887698765000096], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

But in this context, it seems more like a criticism because the struggle is being called ridiculous. Then there's \"borderline insulting,\" which clearly indicates offense and negativity.\n\nPutting it together, the speaker feels that the struggle is not just silly but also offensive. That's a strong negative sentiment. It doesn't reach 0 (very negative) because while it's critical, it might not be as harsh as other terms.

The text provided is: \"it seems impossible that an epic four-hour indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is .\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to understand its components. The user starts by saying it's \"impossible\" that such a movie would be good. That word 'impossible' has a negative connotation because it suggests something can't happen or isn't expected to be positive. However, the second part of the sentence flips that expectation: \"but it is.\" This shows that despite initial doubts, the outcome was actually positive.\n\nSo the structure here is setting up an expectation with a negative adjective ('impossible') but then negating that with a positive conclusion. It's like saying, \"I didn't think this could be good, but it actually is.\" That kind of phrasing usually conveys surprise and appreciation. \n\nNext, I'll consider the words used. 'Epic' can sometimes have a neutral or even positive connotation depending on context. In this case, since it's describing a four-hour movie about cricket, which might not immediately seem appealing to everyone, using 'epic' could imply that despite its length and subject, it was impactful or grand in scope.\n\nThe phrase \"could be this good\" is interesting because it suggests that the quality exceeded expectations. The use of 'this good' indicates a high level of satisfaction, so the sentiment isn't just positive but quite strong.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence starts with a negative assumption but quickly turns to a very positive reality. The overall tone seems enthusiastic and approving. Therefore, while there's an element of surprise, the sentiment leans towards being very positive because the conclusion is so favorable.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other nuances. There's no use of strong negative words beyond 'impossible,' which is quickly countered by the positive outcome. The exclamation at the end in the user's previous response emphasizes positivity, but that might not be directly present here. However, the structure still conveys a strong positive sentiment.\n\nIn terms of classification, 4 represents very positive.

The user provided a sentence: \"this picture is murder by numbers, and as easy to be bored by as your abc's, despite a few whopping shootouts.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break it down. \"Murder by Numbers\" might refer to a movie or something similar, but the main sentiment comes from the adjectives used. The phrase \"as easy to be bored by as your abc's\" suggests that the picture is very dull and boring, like learning basic alphabet\u2014something simple that might not hold interest for long.\n\nThe word \"bored\" indicates a negative emotion here. Additionally, the mention of \"a few whopping shootouts\" seems positive at first glance because shootouts are exciting. However, the phrase \"despite\" shows that even with these elements, the overall experience is still boring. So, despite some thrilling parts, the main sentiment leans towards boredom and dissatisfaction.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment isn't extremely negative but definitely negative. There's a sense of disappointment because the excitement didn't make up for how dull the rest was. So, I'd classify this as a 1 on the scale\u2014negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a negative sentiment due to boredom despite some exciting elements.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 0, 25.53345344000263], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

First, the text starts with \"star trek was kind of terrific once.\" That sounds positive because \"terrific\" is a strong positive word. So initially, it seems like they had a good experience with Star Trek.\n\nThen the second part says, \"but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy.\" The word \"copy\" here probably means that the current version isn't original or has lost its quality. Using \"copy of a copy of a copy\" emphasizes that it's been diluted or repeated too many times, which sounds negative.\n\nSo there's a contrast between the past positive experience and the current dissatisfaction. The user is expressing that while they liked Star Trek before, now it's not as good\u2014it feels repetitive and lacks originality. \n\nThe sentiment here isn't extremely negative because they acknowledge that it was once great. But they're clearly disappointed with the present state. So it leans more towards negative than neutral but not extremely so.\n\nI think this would be a 1 (negative) because while there's some positivity in the past, the focus is on the current negativity.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed is negative due to the disappointment with the current state of Star Trek despite its past appeal. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 32.3030624279927], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts by saying something defies logic and the laws of physics. That usually has a negative connotation because defying these things suggests something isn't making sense or can't happen in reality. Then it says \"almost anyone's willingness to believe in it.\" This part implies that most people wouldn't believe it, which is also negative.\n\nPutting it together, the text is expressing disbelief and criticism. The use of words like \"defies\" and \"willingness to believe\" indicate a skeptical or dismissive attitude. It doesn't seem positive at all; instead, it leans towards negative because it's pointing out flaws or impossibilities.\n\nI should consider if there are any positive elements here. Maybe someone could argue that defying logic is innovative, but given the context, especially mentioning \"almost anyone's willingness to believe,\" it seems more critical than complimentary.\n\nSo, thinking about the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The sentiment here is clearly on the negative side because of the disbelief and criticism expressed. But how strong is that negativity?\n\nUsing words like \"defies\" and stating it goes against physics and belief suggests a stronger negative sentiment rather than just slightly negative. However, it's not extremely harsh; there are no strong adjectives or profanity. So maybe it's in the middle of the negative side.\n\nBetween 0 (very negative) and 1 (negative), I think this is more towards negative but not the most extreme.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's look at the words used. The phrase starts with \"a pure participatory event,\" which sounds neutral or maybe even slightly positive because \"pure\" and \"participatory\" could imply something genuine and engaging. But then it takes a turn with \"malnourished intellectuals.\" Hmm, malnourished usually refers to not having enough nutrients, so metaphorically, it might mean they're lacking in knowledge or experience.\n\nThe next part is \"will gulp down in a frenzy.\" Gulping suggests urgency or eagerness, but a frenzy can be seen as chaotic or excessive. So putting it together: the event is being consumed eagerly by intellectuals who are described as malnourished. It might imply that these intellectuals are so hungry for something (maybe knowledge, interaction) that they're reacting in an intense way.\n\nNow, sentiment-wise, \"malnourished\" has a negative connotation because it implies deficiency or lack. But the eagerness to participate could be seen positively as enthusiasm. However, the overall tone seems to blend both aspects. The intellectuals are desperate (negative) but also eager (positive). It's a bit mixed.\n\nI think the key here is \"malnourished.\" That word leans negative because it suggests a deficiency or neediness. Even though they're participating eagerly, their state is portrayed as lacking. So the sentiment isn't entirely positive. On the other hand, it's not completely negative either because participation and eagerness are positive traits.\n\nSo considering all that, I might rate this as 1 (negative) because the negative aspect of being malnourished stands out more than the positive aspects of participation. Alternatively, someone could argue it's neutral if they see both sides balancing out, but since \"malnourished\" has a stronger emotional charge, I think it tips slightly negative.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is classified as 1 (negative). \n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. The phrase begins with a neutral-positive description of an event.\n2. The term \"malnourished intellectuals\" introduces a negative connotation, implying deficiency or lack.\n3. The eagerness to participate (\"gulp down in a frenzy\") suggests positive engagement but is overshadowed by the preceding negativity.\n4.

The main subject here is \"the satire,\" so they're talking about a satirical work, maybe a show, movie, or article. Now, the phrase \"just too easy\" stands out to me. That suggests that whatever the satire was aiming for wasn't particularly challenging or clever\u2014it felt simple or perhaps even lazy.\n\nThen there's \"to be genuinely satisfying.\" The word \"genuinely\" adds emphasis here. It means the satisfaction isn't just superficial; it's about whether it truly meets expectations. But because of how easy the satire is, the person doesn't find it satisfying in a real way.\n\nPutting this together, the sentiment seems negative. They're disappointed because the satire didn't meet their standards\u2014it was too simplistic and therefore not fulfilling. However, it's not extremely negative; they don't use harsher words like \"awful\" or \"terrible.\" It's more of a mild criticism, so maybe a 1 (negative) rather than a 0.\n\nWait, but sometimes people can express dissatisfaction in different ways. Is there any positive spin here? The person is talking about whether it's satisfying, which implies they were looking for something deeper. So their expectation wasn't met, leading to disappointment. That leans more towards negative than neutral.\n\nI don't think it's neutral because the use of \"too easy\" and \"not genuinely satisfying\" clearly conveys dissatisfaction. It's not a balanced view but rather an opinion that expresses disappointment. \n\nSo considering all this, I would classify this sentiment as 1 (negative). It's not extremely negative, just a bit on the lower side because of the disappointment expressed.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses disappointment with the satire being too simple and not satisfying.

Let me read the sentence again: \"although the subject matter may still be too close to recent national events, the film works - mostly due to its superior cast of characters.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break it down. The sentence starts with a negative point. It says that the subject matter is too close to recent national events. That could imply that some people might find it sensitive or not well-received because it's too current or perhaps touches on something traumatic. So that part seems slightly negative.\n\nBut then the sentence shifts. After \"although,\" which usually sets up a contrast, the second part says, \"the film works - mostly due to its superior cast of characters.\" The word \"works\" is positive, and \"superior cast\" is definitely a compliment. That suggests that despite the potential issue with the subject matter being too timely, the film succeeds because of its strong characters.\n\nSo, balancing these two parts: there's a minor negative point about the subject matter being too close to recent events, but it's overshadowed by the positive assessment of the film's success due to its cast. The overall sentiment seems more positive than negative because the latter part is stronger and concludes that the film does work.\n\nI don't think it's extremely positive because there was a caveat mentioned about the subject matter. So maybe not a 4 (very positive), but definitely leaning towards positive, which would be a 3.\n</think>\n\nThe text acknowledges a potential issue with the subject matter but ultimately praises the film for its cast.

This could be seen as a slight negative because it's not meeting higher expectations.\n\nThe second part states that it's \"not bad prose.\" Prose is more straightforward writing, so calling it not bad means it's decent but maybe not outstanding either. So this part is slightly positive but not overly so.\n\nPutting these together, the sentiment isn't strongly negative or positive.

That sounds like disappointment. \n\nI think about how people express dissatisfaction\u2014they often use phrases like \"should be\" which implies expectation versus reality. Here, the reality is that it doesn't do those things, so there's a letdown.

That doesn't immediately sound negative or positive; it's more descriptive. But then it continues: \"schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs.\" Here, I detect a criticism because it's saying the film doesn't achieve the desired \"enchantment\" that the story requires. The word \"never\" is strong here, indicating that this was an expectation that wasn't met.\n\nNext part: \"the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm.\" Again, another negative point. It's pointing out that while the characters have unique traits (quirks and foibles), they don't come together to create something charming. The use of \"never\" again emphasizes that this was a missed opportunity.\n\nPutting it all together, the text is criticizing the film for not living up to its potential in terms of tone and character development. It doesn't seem overly harsh, but there are clear points of dissatisfaction. So on the scale from 0 to 4, with 0 being very negative, I think this is more than neutral (2) because it's pointing out shortcomings without any positive remarks. But how strong is the negativity? The language isn't excessively harsh; instead, it's a measured critique.

So it doesn't lean towards positive or negative but is just average.\n\nNext, the text compares it to \"truth or consequences, n.m.\" I'm not sure what specific movie or work this refers to, but it's followed by a description of an \"interchangeable actioner\" with \"imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater.\" \n\nBreaking down the descriptors:\n\n- \"Interchangeable\": This means it's similar to many others and not unique. It doesn't carry much sentiment on its own.\n- \"Imbecilic\": That's a strong negative term, meaning very stupid or foolish.\n- \"Toolbags botching a routine assignment\": Botching means messing up, so this is another negative point.\n- \"Western backwater\": This might suggest a setting that's remote or insignificant, which could be neutral but may carry some slight negativity depending on context.\n\nPutting it all together: The text seems to describe something as average compared to other similar action movies. It uses strong negative terms like \"imbecilic\" and \"botching,\" which convey frustration or disappointment with the characters' incompetence. However, since it's comparing it neutrally without stronger positive language, I don't think it's extremely negative but still leans towards negative.\n\nConsidering the options:\n\n0 - Very negative: The text isn't extremely harsh; it's more of a criticism but not overly so.\n1 - Negative: This seems to fit because there are clear negative descriptors like \"imbecilic\" and \"botching.\"\n2 - Neutral: While it starts with a neutral comparison, the rest leans negative.\n3 - Positive or 4 - Very positive: There's nothing positive here.\n\nSo, I think the sentiment is negative but not extremely so.

The user is talking about a Bond film going off the beaten path. Going off the beaten path could mean something new or different, which might be seen as positive in some contexts because it suggests creativity or innovation.\n\nBut then the next part says \"not necessarily for the better.\" That phrase is key here. It implies that while the film did take a different approach, it didn't result in an improvement. So, this seems to indicate dissatisfaction or a negative sentiment about the change.\n\nPutting it together: The reviewer acknowledges some novelty but doesn't think it was an improvement. This suggests a negative opinion overall because they're implying that changing course wasn't beneficial. \n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. Since the sentiment leans towards negative but isn't extremely so, I think it's either a 1 or a 0.

If they went off the beaten path and it wasn't better, does that mean it was worse? Or just different without improvement? It could be a bit ambiguous.

The text provided is: \"a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to understand its components. The phrase starts with \"a somber film.\" The word \"somber\" generally has a negative connotation, implying seriousness or gloominess. So that's a point towards a more negative sentiment.\n\nNext part is \"almost completely unrelieved by any comedy.\" Here, \"unrelieved\" suggests that there was no lightening of the mood through comedy. That reinforces the idea that the film doesn't have elements to make it less serious or sad. This also leans towards a negative sentiment because if something is not relieved, especially in the context of a film, it might be quite heavy or depressing.\n\nThen it mentions \"beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor.\" The word \"wistful\" usually carries a bittersweet or nostalgic feeling. Ironies here refer to situations that are contradictory or amusingly different from expectations. However, since it's tied to \"the working poor,\" it might be highlighting some hardships or struggles in their daily lives, which adds a layer of sadness rather than humor.\n\nPutting this all together: the film is described as somber with little to no comedy, and any ironies present are wistful and related to the challenges faced by the working class. This combination suggests that the overall tone is quite serious and perhaps even melancholic. While there's a mention of everyday ironies, they don't seem to lighten the mood in a positive way but rather add to the somberness.\n\nI need to decide where this falls on the scale from 0 to 4. Since it's very negative with few redeeming qualities like comedy, I think it's more than just negative (which would be 1). It seems quite intense in its negativity because of the lack of relief and the focus on somber aspects.

So far, that's leaning towards a positive sentiment.\n\nNow looking at the second part: \"as any of David Mamet's airless cinematic shell games.\" I know David Mamet is known for his intense, dialogue-driven films that can be complex and sometimes leave audiences feeling a bit overwhelmed or \"airless,\" which might not always be positive. The term \"shell games\" refers to a type of con game, suggesting something manipulative or tricky.\n\nPutting it together, the sentence seems to compare whatever is being discussed (maybe another work) to Mamet's style. The use of \"tricky and satisfying\" suggests that while it's complex, it's also rewarding. However, mentioning \"airless cinematic shell games\" could imply that there's a negative aspect, like making the audience feel trapped or manipulated.\n\nSo, I'm torn between positive and neutral. On one hand, \"satisfying\" is positive, but on the other, comparing to Mamet's style might not be entirely complimentary. The overall sentiment feels more positive because it highlights something being challenging yet rewarding, even if there's a slightly negative connotation in the comparison.\n\nI think this leans towards neutral or slightly positive.

This comparison might carry positive connotations since\u8fea\u58eb\u5c3c\u7ecf\u5178 usually has a positive reputation.\n\nThe next part says it \"makes one long for a geriatric peter.\" The word \"longs for\" implies a desire or nostalgia, which is generally positive. However, referring to Peter as \"geriatric\" adds a twist. Geriatric refers to the elderly, so this could be interpreted in two ways: either it's expressing a longing for an aged version of Peter, which might evoke nostalgia (positive), or it could suggest that the follow-up is outdated or has aged poorly, which would be negative.\n\nConsidering the structure, \"makes one long for\" suggests a desire, and the mention of a geriatric Peter might be pointing out that the follow-up feels old-fashioned. So, perhaps the sentiment is slightly negative because it's comparing unfavorably to the original, implying that the new version isn't as fresh or innovative. \n\nBut wait, could \"longing\" still carry a positive nuance despite the age reference? Maybe the person appreciates the classic elements and misses the original Peter. In that case, the sentiment might lean towards neutral or slightly positive because they're nostalgic for the original.\n\nI'm a bit torn here. The sentence doesn't use overtly negative words like \"bad\" or \"terrible,\" but it does mention similarity to an older work which could be seen as a criticism if implying lack of innovation. However, the longing for Peter could also indicate that the follow-up brings back good memories.\n\nAfter considering both angles, I think the sentiment is slightly positive because the focus is on nostalgia and appreciation for the original rather than outright criticism. So, it's not negative enough to be 1 or very negative (0), nor is it neutral (2). It might fall into a positive category but not extremely so.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 2, 49.775727450003615], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is: \"rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each sentiment score represents. Sentiment analysis usually involves determining the emotional tone behind words used in text. Here, 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 is neutral, 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive.\n\nLooking at the text, it's talking about \"rice\" (probably a person's name) not clearly defining his characters or giving reasons to care about them. The words used here are \"never,\" which is a strong negative word, and \"clearly defines.\" So, the statement is pointing out that there's a lack of character development.\n\nI should consider if this sentiment is very negative or just negative. The use of \"never\" suggests a strong dissatisfaction, indicating that the issue is consistent and problematic. This points more towards a very negative sentiment rather than just a general negative one.\n\nHowever, I also need to make sure I'm not overstepping. Maybe the user wants a 0 only for extremely harsh criticism, but in this case, it's a clear critique about character development, which can significantly affect how engaging a story is. So, it might be appropriate to consider it very negative because it points out a major flaw.\n\nBut wait, could there be any nuance I'm missing? Maybe the user didn't specify whether \"rice\" refers to a book, movie, or another context. However, without more context, I have to go with what's given.

In this case, since it's paired with \"vibrant,\" I think it means something that evokes strong emotions or has a powerful impact. It often carries a positive connotation because it suggests depth and emotional resonance.\n\nNext, the term \"vibrant\" typically describes something full of energy, life, or color. This is definitely a positive adjective as it implies dynamism and vitality, which are favorable traits.\n\nConsidering both words together, they seem to convey a sense of positivity without being overly enthusiastic. Neither word leans towards the extreme end of the scale; instead, they suggest an active, lively, and emotionally engaging experience.\n\nOn the scale provided:\n- 0: Very negative\n- 1: Negative\n- 2: Neutral\n- 3: Positive\n- 4: Very positive\n\nSince both words are positive but not extremely so, I would rate this as a 3.

It says that Reno can take credit for most of the movie's success. That sounds like a compliment towards Reno, right? So the sentiment should be positive.\n\nNow, I need to decide how strong this positivity is. The word \"success\" has a clearly positive connotation, and taking credit implies contribution or responsibility for that success. There are no negative words here, so it doesn't seem neutral. It's definitely not negative or very negative either.\n\nThe phrase uses \"most of the movie's success,\" which suggests that Reno played a significant role but maybe not all of it. That might make it moderately positive rather than extremely so. So I'm thinking between 3 and 4.\n\nSince the sentiment is clearly positive without any strong modifiers, like \"amazing\" or \"brilliant,\" it probably doesn't reach a 4 (very positive). It's more on the higher side of positive but not at the extreme. So I'll go with 3 for positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text compliments Reno by attributing most of the movie's success to him, indicating a positive sentiment without extreme language.\n\n3", 3, 3, 27.98048112698598], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts with \"Uzumaki's interesting social parallel,\" which sounds positive because \"interesting\" is a favorable adjective. Then it mentions \"defiant aesthetic,\" another positive point since \"defiant\" can imply uniqueness or boldness.\n\nHowever, the latter part says, \"seems a prostituted muse.\" The word \"prostituted\" here is negative\u2014it usually means being exploited for profit, which has a derogatory connotation. Using it to describe something as a muse might indicate that the subject is being used in an exploitative or degraded way.\n\nSo there's a mix of positive and negative elements. The first part praises the work, but the second part criticizes it harshly. I need to weigh these against each other. The criticism seems stronger because \"prostituted\" is a strong negative word that overshadows the initial positives. \n\nPutting this together, the overall sentiment leans more towards negative than positive.

The speaker is giving advice to someone involved in \"The Singles Ward,\" which I assume is a TV show or some media production. They're telling them that having celebrities make appearances (cameos) doesn't necessarily lead to funny moments.\n\nSo the sentiment isn't overtly positive because they're not praising anything. Instead, they're pointing out a potential flaw or misconception in the approach of using celebrity cameos for humor. The phrase \"do not automatically equal\" suggests that there's an expectation that hasn't been met\u2014celebrities aren't delivering the laughs as hoped.\n\nOn the other hand, it's not extremely negative either because they're offering constructive feedback rather than outright criticism. They're suggesting that maybe relying on celebrity cameos isn't sufficient for creating humor; perhaps more thought is needed into how to generate laughs beyond just having famous people appear.\n\nConsidering all this, the sentiment seems neutral but leaning slightly towards negative because it's pointing out a potential issue without overtly praising or excessively criticizing.

They mention being part of \"grand locations,\" which sounds positive. Then they're thinking urgently because the protagonists are struggling\u2014that could be intense but not necessarily negative. They feel at the mercy of the inventiveness, which might imply something overwhelming in a good way, maybe? And gasping at visual delights definitely seems like a very positive reaction.\n\nThe words used here like \"grand,\" \"inventiveness,\" and \"visual delights\" all have positive connotations. The person is describing an immersive experience where they're fully engaged, which usually indicates a strong positive sentiment.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment expressed is very positive.

The user gave me a specific scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. My task is to read the provided sentence and assign it one of these integers.\n\nThe sentence given is: \"this version moves beyond the original 's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema 's inability to stand in for true , lived experience .\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. It's talking about a version (maybe a remake or reimagining) moving beyond something. The original had nostalgia for communal film experiences from the past\u2014like how people used to go to the movies together. Now, this new version goes further into realizing that cinema can't fully replace real, lived experiences.\n\nI need to determine if this is positive or negative. Let's look at the words used. \"Moves beyond\" suggests progress or advancement. The original had nostalgia, which is generally a positive emotion because it's about\u6000\u5ff5\u7f8e\u597d\u7684\u8fc7\u53bb. But now, this version has a deeper realization about cinema's inability to substitute real experiences.\n\nHmm, so the sentiment here seems to be pointing out a limitation of cinema\u2014something negative. However, it's presented in a way that suggests moving past just nostalgia into something more reflective or insightful. So is the overall tone negative because it points out a flaw, or neutral because it's an observation?\n\nI think \"inability\" carries a slightly negative connotation. It's saying that cinema can't replace real experiences, which might be seen as a criticism of cinema. However, the way it's phrased\u2014it's moving beyond nostalgia\u2014could also imply that this version is more mature or realistic in its approach.\n\nBut without any explicitly positive words, and considering \"inability\" is a negative term, I'm leaning towards neutral because it's more of an observation rather than a strong opinion. The sentence isn't overly praising or criticizing; it's stating a realization.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 2, 43.480628635996254], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

In some cases, saying someone has worked too hard might imply that they put in an excessive amount of effort, which could be seen as negative if it's leading to burnout or stress. On the other hand, it could also be interpreted positively because working hard often leads to good results.\n\nIn this sentence, though, there's no explicit indication of whether the hard work was productive or not. The speaker is just stating that he worked too hard on the movie. Without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. However, in general, when someone talks about someone else working too hard, especially in a creative project like a movie, it might carry a tone of admiration or concern. \n\nIf I lean towards admiration, then the sentiment would be positive because it acknowledges dedication and effort. On the other hand, if it's more of a concern that he overexerted himself, it could be slightly negative. But since the sentence doesn't express any negativity explicitly\u2014like complaining about the outcome or fatigue\u2014it's probably leaning towards a neutral to slightly positive sentiment.\n\nConsidering that, I think assigning it a 2 (neutral) might make sense because there's no clear indication of positivity or negativity beyond stating effort. However, sometimes acknowledging hard work can be seen as a compliment, which would push it closer to a 3. But without more context, it's safer to go with neutral.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed is neutral.\n\n2", 2, 2, 36.98444272298366], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase \"it's hard to believe\" often indicates surprise or disbelief, sometimes with a negative undertone. Here, it seems like the speaker is shocked that something short (maybe a movie, book, or product) could be flabby. \n\nThe word \"flabby\" isn't used here in its literal sense but metaphorically. In this context, \"flabby\" probably means lacking substance, weak, or not well-structured. So the sentence is pointing out that despite being short, the thing in question feels long-winded or ineffective. That's a negative critique because it implies that the work isn't making good use of its time or space.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. The sentiment here is clearly negative but not extremely so. It's more about disappointment than outright anger or frustration. So it doesn't reach a 0, which would be reserved for something strongly negative.\n\nI think the appropriate classification here would be 1 (negative) because the statement expresses dissatisfaction without being overly harsh. There are no superlatives like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" just a critique that points out inefficiency.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence expresses a negative sentiment, indicating disappointment with the lack of substance in something short.\n\n1", 1, 1, 35.571745977009414], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The words used here are \"deftly entertaining,\" \"smartly played,\" and \"smartly directed.\" These all sound like compliments. Let's break them down:\n\n- \"Deftly\" means skillfully or cleverly, so describing the film as deftly entertaining suggests it's enjoyable in a clever way.\n- \"Smartly played\" indicates that the acting is intelligent or well-done.\n- \"Smartly directed\" implies that the direction was also done with intelligence and skill.\n\nPutting this together, all these adjectives are positive. The use of \"entertaining\" directly points to a positive experience. There's no negative language here; everything seems complimentary about both the film itself and its execution.\n\nI'm thinking about whether any of these words could have double meanings or be neutral. But in context, they're clearly used positively. So the sentiment isn't just positive but also very high praise because it's not just saying it's good, but that it's smartly done, which adds depth to the positivity.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 is very negative, which doesn't apply here. 1 is negative, which also doesn't fit. Neutral is 2, but this text isn't neutral\u2014it's clearly positive. Now between 3 and 4: 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive. Given that all descriptors are strong positives, I think it leans towards the higher end.\n\nSo, I believe the sentiment is very positive, which corresponds to a score of 4.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses highly complimentary language such as \"deftly entertaining,\" \"smartly played,\" and \"smartly directed.\" These terms indicate not just positivity but a high level of praise for both the film's entertainment value and its execution.\n\n4", 4, 4, 42.53422868900816], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase starts with \"better still,\" which seems positive, suggesting an improvement or something even better than before. Then it says he does all of this and more, so that's another positive indicator. He's being praised for doing a lot.\n\nThe next part is about being one of the most savagely hilarious social critics. \"Savagely hilarious\" sounds like a strong positive because it combines intensity with humor. Jonathan Swift was known for his sharp wit and satirical works, so comparing someone to him in this context likely means they're also highly regarded for their criticism.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment is definitely positive. The use of \"better still,\" doing more than expected, and being compared favorably to a renowned figure like Jonathan Swift all point towards a very positive sentiment.

The text provided is: \"if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. It starts with \"If ever,\" which sets up a hypothetical situation. Then it mentions a \"dependable concept,\" so that's something positive because dependability is a good trait. However, the next part says it was \"botched in execution.\" The word \"botched\" means to mess up or fail badly, so that's definitely negative.\n\nPutting those together, the sentence is saying that even though the concept itself was solid and reliable, its execution failed. So there's a mix of positive and negative elements here. But since the focus is on how the execution went wrong despite being based on a good idea, the sentiment leans more towards negative because the outcome isn't favorable.\n\nI should also consider the intensity of the words. \"Dependable\" is a strong positive adjective, but \"botched\" is a harsh word that conveys significant failure or mishandling. The phrase \"this is it\" at the end seems to emphasize that this particular case exemplifies how something was messed up.\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, etc. Since the sentence highlights a clear failure in execution despite having a good concept, it's more than just slightly negative. It feels like a strong criticism of the execution, which would make it quite negative but not extremely so.\n\nSo considering all this, I think the sentiment falls into category 1 (negative). It's not as extreme as very negative because while there's disappointment, it doesn't express anger or frustration beyond pointing out a significant flaw in how something was carried out.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a negative sentiment due to the failure in execution of a dependable concept.

Let me break down the sentence they provided: \"stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy , the film operates nicely off the element of surprise , and the large cast is solid .\"\n\nFirst, I notice that each part of the sentence seems positive. They say Steven has a flair for dialogue comedy, which implies he's good at it\u2014so that's a plus. Then they mention the film uses the element of surprise nicely, which again sounds positive because using surprise well can make a movie engaging.

The text mentions two adjectives: \"polished\" and \"well-structured.\" Both of these are clearly positive terms in this context.\n\n\"Polished\" usually means something is smooth and refined, which in film terms suggests quality and effort put into making it look good. It's a compliment.\n\n\" Well-structured\" indicates that the film has a solid, logical flow or organization. This is another positive attribute because structure is important for storytelling and audience engagement.\n\nSince both words are positive, the sentiment here isn't neutral or negative.

The user gave a sentence: \"A summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie, for that comes through all too painfully in the execution.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the words. \"Doesn't do justice\" usually means something isn't being represented well. Then there's \"awfulness,\" which is clearly a negative term. The phrase \"comes through all too painfully\" adds more negativity, emphasizing how bad it feels.\n\nPutting it together, the person is saying that even summarizing the plot doesn't capture how awful the movie is, and watching it makes the awfulness very clear. So they're expressing strong dislike for the movie.\n\nI need to map this sentiment on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). Since there are strong negative words like \"awfulness\" and phrases that emphasize pain, this should be at least a 0 or 1. But wait, 0 is very negative. The user said the summary doesn't capture how bad it is, so maybe it's more than just negative\u2014it's extremely so.\n\nHmm, but sometimes people use \"doesn't do justice\" in both positive and negative contexts. In this case, though, they're talking about the movie being awful, so it's definitely negative. The structure of the sentence also seems to amplify the negativity, making me think it's more than just a little negative.\n\nSo I'm leaning towards 0 because of the strong negative terms used.

The question is asking me to classify it on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). \n\nFirst, I'll read the sentence again: \"how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ?\"\n\nThe person is talking about indie filmmakers creating stories that they find boring and self-important. The word \"boring\" has a negative connotation here, indicating dissatisfaction or dislike. Also, the phrase \"how horrible we are to ourselves and each other\" suggests that the content of these stories is unpleasant or distressing.\n\nThe overall tone seems critical and frustrated. They're questioning how many more times they'll have to endure this type of storytelling, which implies a strong negative sentiment. There's no positive language here; instead, it's filled with criticism and annoyance towards indie filmmakers for producing what the speaker perceives as poor quality or unappealing content.\n\nI don't see any neutral elements in the sentence. It's clearly expressing frustration and disappointment, so it doesn't fall into a neutral category. The sentiment is definitely negative. Now, considering how strong this negativity is, \"boring\" is a fairly strong adjective, but it's not as extreme as something like \"horrific\" or \"terrible.\" However, combining it with \"self-important\" and the overall critical tone might push it towards a slightly more intense negative sentiment.\n\nSo, on the scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive. I think this would be a 1 because it's clearly negative but not extremely so. It doesn't use overly harsh language beyond criticism and frustration, which makes me lean towards a 1 rather than a 0.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to words like \"boring,\" \"self-important,\" and criticism of indie filmmakers' stories. The tone conveys frustration and dissatisfaction without extreme language, leading to a classification of:\n\n1", 1, 1, 43.26823031899403], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe text is: \"with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand the context. It mentions a \"new rollerball,\" which I assume is some kind of writing instrument or tool. Then it talks about \"sense and sensibility\" being overrun by \"robotic sentiment.\" \n\nNow, breaking down the phrases:\n- \"Sense and sensibility\" usually refers to a novel by Jane Austen, known for its emotional depth and character-driven narrative.\n- The phrase \"overrun\" suggests something taking over, perhaps in a negative way.\n- \"Robotic sentiment\" implies that the emotions or expressions are mechanical, lacks genuine feeling.\n\nPutting it together: The text is likely criticizing this new rollerball (maybe a type of pen) for making writing feel emotionless and mechanical. Instead of having rich, human-like qualities (\"sense and sensibility\"), it's now robotic.\n\nLooking at sentiment words:\n- \"Overrun\" has a negative connotation.\n- \"Robotic sentiment\" also leans negative because it suggests something lacks warmth or genuine feeling.\n\nThe overall tone seems to express dissatisfaction with the product. It's not just neutral; there's a clear negative emotion about how the rollerball affects the writing experience.\n\nSo, considering the scale:\n0 - Very negative\n1 - Negative\n2 - Neutral\n3 - Positive\n4 - Very positive\n\nThis sentiment is negative but not extremely so. The criticism isn't overly harsh but points out a flaw. Therefore, it's more than just neutral (which would be 2) and less than very negative (0). So I think it falls into the negative category, which is 1.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 2, 39.51417734101415], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let's break down what each number represents: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 is neutral, 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive.\n\nThe text in question is: \"ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna.\"\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the sentence structure. It's split into two parts connected by \"but.\" The first part says Ritchie doesn't have a novel thought, which seems negative because it implies he lacks creativity or original ideas. However, the second part flips that with a positive note: knowing how to pose Madonna suggests he has some skill or talent, perhaps in photography or posing for photos.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the overall sentiment is more negative or positive. The first clause is definitely negative, pointing out a lack of creativity. But the second part balances it by highlighting his ability in another area. So, while there's criticism in the beginning, it's followed by a compliment.\n\nIs the sentence neutral because it has both elements? Or does one outweigh the other? The structure uses \"but,\" which often introduces a contrast. This could mean that the positive aspect is more emphasized, especially since posing Madonna might be seen as a significant skill or achievement.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if it's leaning towards positive or just neutral. On one hand, it's acknowledging Ritchie's limitation but also recognizing his strength. Without more context about how \"posing Madonna\" is perceived, it's a bit tricky. If posing Madonna is considered impressive, then the sentiment might be slightly positive. However, without knowing that, it could just balance out as neutral.\n\nWait, but in many contexts, having a skill like posing someone famous like Madonna could imply that Ritchie has talent or at least practical skills, which is a positive trait. So maybe the overall sentiment leans towards positive because even though he lacks novel thoughts, his practical abilities are highlighted.\n\nAlternatively, if the focus is more on the criticism of not having novel thoughts, then it might be neutral because both aspects are presented without a clear direction. I think in this case, since the sentence uses \"but\" to contrast a negative with a positive, it's aiming for a balanced view. Therefore, the sentiment isn't extremely positive or negative but rather neutral.\n\nWait again, maybe it's slightly positive because despite the criticism, there's an acknowledgment of his ability. But without stronger positive language, it might just be neutral.

Let me read it again: \"it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made -lrb- eyre 's -rrb- first film something of a sleeper success .\" \n\nAlright, so the sentence is talking about something (probably a movie or a film) and pointing out what it's lacking. The words used are \"compassion,\" \"good-natured humor,\" and \"level of insight.\" These seem like positive attributes that the subject is missing.\n\nThe phrase \"lacks\" indicates a deficiency, which suggests a negative sentiment. But then it mentions that these qualities made Eyre's first film a sleeper success. A sleeper success implies unexpected popularity or acclaim, so that part sounds positive. However, the sentence is saying that this current thing lacks those qualities, meaning it's not as good.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment is negative because it's pointing out shortcomings. But how strong is that negativity? The words used aren't extremely harsh; it's more about lacking positives rather than having negatives. So maybe it's a moderate negative sentiment.\n\nOn the scale of 0 to 4 (with 0 being very negative and 4 very positive), I think this would be a 1, which represents negative sentiment. It doesn't seem extremely negative because there are no strong adjectives like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" just pointing out the absence of good qualities.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence expresses a negative sentiment by noting the lack of certain positive attributes.

The main point seems to be talking about movies featuring angels. The speaker mentions there's a \"problem\" with these movies\u2014they tend to \"slip into hokum.\" Now, what does \"hokum\" mean? I think it refers to something that is exaggerated or unrealistic in a way that's not convincing. So the sentiment here isn't entirely negative; they're pointing out an issue but not outright trashing the idea.\n\nThe sentence starts with \"the problem,\" which immediately suggests some criticism, so there's a negative aspect. However, the overall tone doesn't seem overly harsh. It's more of a cautious observation rather than a scathing review. The word \"tendency\" softens it a bit because it implies it's not always the case but something common.\n\nI should consider if this is neutral or slightly negative. If someone just states that movies about angels have an issue, without strong emotions, it might be leaning towards neutral. But since they're pointing out a flaw, it's probably on the negative side. However, it's not extremely negative because there's no use of strong words like \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" \n\nSo, thinking about the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. This seems more on the negative side but not extremely so. Therefore, it might be a 1 for negative. But wait, sometimes observations can be seen as neutral if they don't express a clear emotion. I'm a bit torn here.\n\nWait, \"problem\" does indicate an issue, which is negative. So even though it's just pointing out the tendency, the mention of hokum suggests that these movies aren't well done in this aspect. So perhaps it leans more towards negative but not extremely so.

The main words here are \"anguish,\" which is a strong negative emotion, and phrases like \"mulls leaving the familiar\" and \"traverse uncharted ground.\" These suggest uncertainty and the unknown, which often have negative connotations.\n\nThe word \"focuses on the anguish\" indicates that the subject is concentrating on a negative feeling. So right there, it's pointing towards a negative sentiment. Now, considering the context of someone leaving something familiar to go into uncharted territory, this can cause anxiety or stress, hence the mention of anguish.\n\nI don't see any positive words in here; everything seems to be about struggle and uncertainty. The sentence doesn't balance the negative with anything positive. So it's pretty one-sided towards negativity.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, etc. Since the focus is on \"anguish,\" which is quite a strong emotion, I think this might lean towards very negative. But sometimes, just having a negative word doesn't automatically make it 0 unless it's extremely intense.\n\nWait, maybe it's not as extreme as that. It's describing someone focusing on the anguish, but perhaps it's more of an exploration rather than expressing raw anger or despair. So maybe it's a 1 instead of a 0 because it's negative but not overly so.\n\nAlternatively, if \"anguish\" is considered a very strong emotion, then 0 might be appropriate. I'm a bit torn here between whether the sentiment is very negative (0) or just negative (1). The sentence doesn't use other intensifiers like \"terrible anguish\" or \"unbearable,\" so maybe it's not the most extreme.\n\nAlso, considering the rest of the sentence talks about leaving familiar ground and uncharted territory. These can be seen as neutral or even positive in some contexts, but combined with \"anguish,\" they contribute to a negative sentiment.\n\nSo putting it all together, the presence of \"anguish\" is strong enough for me to consider it at least 0 (very negative), but I'm not entirely sure if it's that extreme. However, without more context or stronger language, maybe 1 (negative) is safer.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence discusses a focus on \"anguish,\" which is a strong negative emotion.

It starts by comparing this Halloween to its predecessors using \"parade,\" which could have a neutral connotation but might imply that there's a long line of similar events. Then it calls this one a \"gory slash-fest.\" The words \"gory\" and \"slash-fest\" are strong descriptors. \n\n\"Gory\" suggests something violent or bloody, which can be seen as negative if it's referring to excessive violence or being off-putting. However, in the context of a Halloween event, maybe it's just descriptive without necessarily being negative. \"Slash-fest\" implies a lot of action, perhaps fighting or intense scenes, which could be thrilling for some but might come off as too violent or chaotic.\n\nPutting it together, the sentiment seems more on the negative side because of the emphasis on gory and intense content. However, it's not extremely negative; it's just pointing out that this Halloween is similar to past ones in being a violent, action-packed event. So maybe it's leaning towards 1 (negative), but I should consider if it's neutral because it could be a factual description without emotion.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that it's a \"parade of predecessors,\" which might imply criticism or at least a non-positive view.

The main subject is \"Showtime,\" a film. The adjectives used here are \"fine-looking,\" which suggests it's visually appealing. Then there's \"bouncy score\" which implies the music is upbeat and pleasant. Additionally, it mentions \"lively songs,\" indicating that the musical elements are energetic and engaging. The phrase \"deft punctuation\" probably refers to how these songs effectively punctuate or enhance certain parts of the film.\n\nPutting this together, all the descriptors used are positive: fine-looking, bouncy, lively, deft.

The sentence is: \"If divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure , it comes to life in the performances.\"\n\nOkay, let's break it down. First, the beginning part says that the movie or book (I'm assuming it's about \"Divine Secrets\") has a \"ploddingly melodramatic structure.\" The word \"ploddingly\" suggests something slow and maybe tedious. \"Melodramatic\" can sometimes be negative if it means overly dramatic in an unconvincing way. So this part sounds like the author is criticizing the structure as being too slow and overly emotional, which would lean towards a negative sentiment.\n\nThen the sentence changes with \"it comes to life in the performances.\" \"Comes to life\" is a positive phrase, implying that despite the issues with the structure, the performances rescue or enhance the work. So this part is definitely positive.\n\nSo there's a mix here: one part is critical (negative), and the other part is praising (positive). Now I need to determine which sentiment is stronger or how they balance each other out for the overall classification.\n\nThe scale goes from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). Neutral is 2. Let's see, does the positive aspect outweigh the negative? The sentence starts by pointing out a flaw but then immediately follows it with a strong positive note about the performances. It seems like the performances are a significant enough factor that they redeem the work.\n\nSo maybe the overall sentiment isn't entirely neutral because there is both criticism and praise. But since the performances \"come to life,\" which is quite a strong positive, perhaps the sentiment tips slightly towards positive but not extremely so.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the structure is criticized as slow and overly dramatic, which are significant flaws in storytelling, but then the performances make up for it, maybe the overall sentiment is more on the positive side because the redeeming factor is quite notable. But I don't think it's a very positive (4) because the initial criticism might hold some weight.\n\nSo perhaps a 3? Positive but not extremely so.

Starting with \"fanciful\" \u2013 that usually has a positive connotation because it suggests something imaginative and creative. So, that's a good point towards positivity.\n\nNext is \"grisly.\" Hmm, this one is tricky. Grisly means causing horror or shock, so that's more on the negative side. It might indicate something unpleasant or disturbing. This could lower the sentiment score.\n\nThen there's \"engagingly quixotic.\" Quixotic typically refers to being impractical yet romantic, often in a positive light because it suggests someone is idealistic and passionate about their goals, even if they're not realistic. The word \"engagingly\" adds a layer of charm or interest to it, which is positive.\n\nPutting it all together: the phrase combines both positive and negative elements. Fanciful is positive, grisly is negative, and engagingly quixotic leans more towards positive because it's about being charmingly idealistic. The overall sentiment isn't extremely positive or negative because there are mixed feelings here.\n\nI should also consider the structure of the sentence. It says \"by turns,\" which implies that these qualities come one after another. So, it's not a single consistent emotion but rather different aspects. This suggests that the sentiment is balanced rather than strongly leaning in one direction.\n\nGiven all this, I think the sentiment isn't extremely positive or negative. The presence of both positive and negative words means it's likely neutral. Therefore, assigning a score of 2 seems appropriate because it reflects the mixed feelings without being overly tipped towards either positivity or negativity.\n</think>\n\nThe text contains both positive (\"fanciful,\" \"engagingly quixotic\") and negative (\"grisly\") elements, but the overall sentiment is balanced.\n\n2", 2, 3, 45.537371040991275], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Fluff usually means something light, lacking depth.

Additionally, the phrase \"you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives\" suggests that the situations portrayed are relatable and ongoing, which adds to the overall somber tone.\n\nI should consider how strong these negative indicators are. Since the text describes a sustained and intense level of depression throughout, it's not just slightly negative but very much so. Therefore, classifying this as 0 (very negative) makes sense because it conveys a consistent and profound negativity without any counterbalancing positive elements.\n\nI don't see any neutral or positive words here; everything points towards a very negative sentiment.

It's talking about a director, Peter Kosminsky, providing women with an opportunity to showcase their acting skills, referred to here as \"chops,\" which is a slang term that implies skill or expertise. The phrase \"take full advantage\" suggests that they make good use of this opportunity.\n\nI should look for positive words here. \"Gives these women a forum\" could be seen as positive because it's providing them with a platform, which is supportive. \"Demonstrate their acting chops\" highlights their skills in a complimentary way. And \"take full advantage\" implies that they are making the most of it, which is a positive action.\n\nThere's nothing negative mentioned here. The director isn't criticized; instead, he's praised for giving opportunities. The women are shown in a good light as well. So overall, the sentiment seems positive.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, so this text doesn't fit there. Neutral would be 2, but I think it's more than neutral because it's highlighting positive aspects. Then we have 3 (positive) and 4 (very positive). \n\nThe language used isn't extremely effusive; it's more of a straightforward compliment without superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"extraordinary.\" So maybe not very positive, but still definitely on the positive side.\n\nSo I think the sentiment here is 3, which represents positive.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 3, 36.943482192000374], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The first part says it's \"more dutiful than enchanting.\" So, \"dutiful\" sounds like something that's done out of obligation rather than enjoyment. That doesn't sound very positive. Then comparing it to being \"enchanting,\" which is a positive term, so saying it's more dutiful implies it's not as charming or magical.\n\nNext part: \"... terribly episodic...\" The word \"terribly\" is a strong negative adverb here. It describes something that's really bad in this context\u2014probably indicating the content was too segmented or lacked coherence, which isn't good.\n\nAnd then, \"...lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat.\" This part uses \"lacking,\" another negative term, and says there's no spark of imagination. That suggests creativity is missing. The phrase \"exhilarating treat\" is positive, but since it's saying it lacks what could make it so, the overall sentiment here is negative.\n\nPutting it all together: words like \"dutiful,\" \"terribly episodic,\" and \"lacking the spark of imagination\" are all negatives. There's no positive language except for the hypothetical \"exhilarating treat,\" but that's used in a negative context because it wasn't achieved. So, overall, the sentiment is negative.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. This text doesn't seem extremely negative; it's more on the negative side but not the worst possible. The use of \"terribly\" suggests a strong negative emotion, so maybe it leans towards 0 or 1.\n\nBut let me think again\u2014does it express extreme negativity? Words like \"terrible\" can be quite strong, but in this context, it's describing being episodic rather than something life-threatening. So perhaps it's not the most severe negative sentiment. Maybe a 1 would suffice as it's clearly negative without being overly harsh.\n\nWait, but another perspective: The text is pointing out several flaws\u2014lack of imagination, being too segmented\u2014and using strong adjectives like \"terribly.\" That might push it towards a very negative score because it's not just a minor complaint. So maybe 0? Or perhaps the user considers 1 as negative and 0 as very negative. I'm a bit torn here.\n\nI think since \"terribly\" is used, which is quite strong, but the rest of the terms are also negative without being excessively harsh. Maybe it's not the most extreme negative sentiment possible. Therefore, maybe assigning a 1 is more accurate\u2014it's negative but perhaps not as intense as very negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a clearly negative sentiment with strong adjectives like \"terribly\" indicating significant dissatisfaction.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 62.077847732027294], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It says that \"snow dogs\" have \"both.\" But wait, \"both\" what? The sentence seems incomplete or maybe there was a typo because it ends abruptly after \"both.\" That makes me think that perhaps the original text is missing some words. Without knowing what they're referring to as having both of something, it's hard to gauge the sentiment.\n\nIf I consider just the given phrase, \"snow dogs ' has both,\" without any additional context, I have to evaluate it based on what's present. The mention of \"snow dogs\" could refer to a movie or maybe a book. Alternatively, it might be about actual dogs in snow. But since it's followed by \"has both,\" I'm assuming that the user intended to say something like \"snow dogs has both humor and drama\" or something similar.\n\nAssuming the phrase was meant to express that \"snow dogs\" possesses two qualities, which are positive, then the sentiment would be positive. However, without knowing exactly what those qualities are, it's still a bit ambiguous. If \"both\" refers to good things, like enjoyable elements, then the sentiment is positive. But if it's referring to negative aspects, that could change the sentiment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"snow dogs ' has both\" is part of a larger sentence or context. Maybe the user pasted only a snippet, and the rest was cut off. In that case, without more information, it's difficult to assess accurately. \n\nGiven all this, I think the safest assumption is that the phrase is neutral because it doesn't clearly express any positive or negative emotion on its own. However, if \"both\" refers to two good things, then it might lean towards positive. Since I can't be sure, but considering the structure, it's likely pointing out a balanced view rather than expressing a strong sentiment.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 2, 42.50544814200839], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is: \"while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey does n't really go anywhere .\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. The first part says that each moment is rich in emotional texture. That sounds positive because being rich in emotion suggests depth and engagement, which are generally good things.\n\nHowever, the second part mentions that the journey doesn't really go anywhere. This implies that despite the emotional depth, there's a lack of direction or development. It's like saying something has potential but fails to realize it. So this is more negative because it's pointing out a flaw in the overall structure or progression.\n\nNow, I have to weigh these two parts. The first part is positive, and the second is negative. But how strong are each of them?\n\nThe emotional texture being rich suggests that there's a lot going on emotionally, which can be engaging for the audience. That's a positive aspect. On the other hand, the journey not going anywhere implies that the story or character development lacks direction, which might make it unsatisfying overall.\n\nSo, putting these together, I'm thinking the sentiment is mixed but leans more negative because while there are positive elements in terms of emotional depth, the failure to develop a meaningful journey overshadows that. It's like saying something has potential but doesn't deliver, which can be disappointing.\n\nI need to assign a score between 0 and 4. Since it's not extremely negative (there's still some positive aspects), it might be either 1 or 2. But because the negative aspect points out a significant flaw in the journey, I think it's more negative than neutral. So perhaps a 1.\n\nWait, but maybe it's more balanced. The emotional richness is quite strong, but the lack of direction is also significant. So perhaps it's neutral? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the positive aspect is about the quality of each moment, while the negative is about the overall journey not progressing, which might be a bigger issue. Maybe 1 because the negative point is more impactful on the overall assessment.\n\nI think I'll go with 1 as the sentiment classification.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 1, 48.235492913023336], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the words used. \"Doesn't beat\" suggests that something isn't reaching a certain standard or expectation. The phrase \"either\" adds to this, implying that not only one thing doesn't meet the mark, but another (in this case, Windtalkers) also fails in comparison.\n\nThe structure of the sentence is somewhat negative because it's pointing out that Windtalkers doesn't surpass \"that one.\" There's a sense of disappointment or underachievement here. The word choice isn't harshly negative; there are no strong adjectives like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" but it does express dissatisfaction.\n\nI'm considering if this is just negative (1) or perhaps neutral (2). Neutral would mean neither positive nor negative, but the phrase clearly indicates a lack of success. So leaning towards negative.\n\nBut wait, could it be more than just negative? The sentiment isn't extremely strong because there's no intense language. It's more of a mild criticism. Therefore, 1 might be appropriate since it's on the negative side but not extremely so.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence expresses disappointment by stating that Windtalkers doesn't surpass another film, indicating a negative sentiment without extreme intensity.\n\nOutput: 1", 1, 1, 32.6324951449933], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The first part mentions \"ugly ideas,\" and the second part talks about \"ugly behavior.\" Both uses of \"ugly\" have negative connotations, which suggests a negative sentiment.\n\nHowever, the sentence then shifts to talk about happiness being present because of storytelling. It says that storytelling is \"far more appealing,\" which is positive. This indicates that despite the initial mention of ugliness, the overall sentiment leans towards something better or more attractive.\n\nNow, considering the structure: The text starts by pointing out negative aspects (\"ugly ideas\" and \"ugly behavior\") but then contrasts that with a positive aspect (\"storytelling is far more appealing\"). So, while there are negative elements mentioned, the focus seems to be on the positive outcome of storytelling outweighing those negatives.\n\nI'm trying to figure out if this balance tips towards positive or remains neutral. The mention of happiness and the appeal of storytelling suggests a positive sentiment despite the initial negatives. But it's not overly enthusiastic; it's more of a moderate positive rather than very positive.\n\nSo, putting it all together: There are negative elements but they are outweighed by the positive aspect of storytelling leading to happiness.

Let me read the sentence again: \"the re-release of ron howard 's apollo 13 in the imax format proves absolutely that really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the words and phrases. The subject is the re-release of Ron Howard's Apollo 13 in IMAX. The verb here is \"proves absolutely,\" which is a strong affirmative statement. Then it says \"really, really, really good things\" \u2013 that repetition of 'really' emphasizes how positive they feel about it.\n\nThe phrase \"can come in enormous packages\" might be metaphorical, suggesting that something big or impressive can deliver great value. So putting it all together, the speaker is highly praising this re-release. They're using strong adjectives and emphasis to convey their positive feelings.\n\nI don't see any negative words here; everything points towards a very positive sentiment. The use of \"absolutely\" and multiple \"reallys\" intensifies the positivity. Since the scale goes from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive), this should be at the higher end. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think it's a 4 for very positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses strong affirmative language and repetition of \"really\" to emphasize its positive sentiment about the re-release.\n\n4", 4, 3, 28.99244243701105], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase \"heavy with flabby rolls\" seems to be describing something that has a lot of excess or bulk. \"Flabby rolls\" usually refers to folds of fat, which can have a negative connotation because it might imply laziness, lack of fitness, or an unattractive appearance.\n\nThen there's the part about \"typical tobacco machinations.\" I think \"tobacco\" here is a typo and should be \"taboo,\" as in something that's socially unacceptable. \"Machinations\" refers to schemes or plots, often with negative connotations because it implies deceit or underhanded plans.\n\nPutting it together, the sentence seems to describe something that's not only physically heavy but also morally or socially questionable. The overall tone is critical and possibly negative towards whatever is being described. \n\nSo considering the sentiment scale, 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive.

The sentence is: \"The strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that, in the simple telling, proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the components of this sentence. The main point is about the strength of a film. It mentions that the strength isn't due to flashy or showy cinematic techniques (\"razzle-dazzle\"), which could imply that those elements aren't present but perhaps it's not a negative thing\u2014just stating facts.\n\nThen, the sentence says the strength comes from \"its recovery of an historical episode.\" Recovery here likely means bringing back or highlighting a past event. So, this suggests that the film is based on real events or historical accounts, which might add depth and significance to the story.\n\nThe phrase \"in the simple telling\" indicates that the narrative doesn't rely on complex storytelling but rather presents the events straightforwardly. This could be seen as a positive aspect because simplicity can make a story more impactful without unnecessary distractions.\n\nNow, the key part is where it says the episode proves \"simultaneously harrowing and uplifting.\" Harrowing means causing intense distress or sadness, while uplifting is the opposite\u2014inspiring hope or optimism. So, the film evokes strong emotions on both ends of that spectrum.\n\nPutting this together: The film's strength isn't in flashy effects but in its storytelling of a historical event that brings both emotional pain and inspiration. This dual effect suggests a deep emotional engagement from the audience. While \"harrowing\" is negative, it's balanced by being \"uplifting,\" which is positive.\n\nI need to decide how this balance affects the overall sentiment. The presence of both elements might lean towards positive because even though there's distress involved, the uplifting aspect could dominate or provide a satisfying emotional journey. Alternatively, if someone values positivity more, they might see it as very positive. But since it's both, maybe it leans more neutral? Wait, but considering that the film is praised for its strength in storytelling despite not using razzle-dazzle, and that it successfully conveys strong emotions, the overall sentiment seems to be on the positive side.\n\nSo I think this would be a 3 (positive) because even though there's some negative emotion involved, the uplifting aspect and the film's effective storytelling make the overall sentiment positive.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is positive due to the film's impactful storytelling of historical events that evoke both harrowing and uplifting emotions. \n\nAnswer: 3", 3, 4, 54.07486446099938], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It talks about a future where movies like Ghost Ship serve as an \"analgesic balm.\" Analgesic means pain-relieving, so it's suggesting that these movies help alleviate some kind of mental stress or overstimulation.\n\nThe phrase \"overstimulated minds\" indicates that people are overwhelmed or perhaps stressed. Using a movie as a balm implies that watching such films is soothing or comforting. So the sentiment here seems positive because it's presenting the film as something beneficial for relaxation.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if there's any negative connotation. The use of \"analgesic\" could be neutral on its own, but in context, it's being used positively to describe how movies can help. There's no explicit negativity; instead, it's a helpful tool against overstimulation.\n\nSo putting it all together: the text is projecting a positive role for these movies, suggesting they have a beneficial effect.

It's talking about Adam Sandler's movie, Eight Crazy Nights. The main part is that it \"grows on you,\" which usually means something becomes better or more liked over time. But then there's a comparison: \"like a rash.\" Hmm, a rash isn't a good thing; it's uncomfortable and often unwanted.\n\nSo the phrase \"grows on you like a rash\" seems to be mixing a positive with a negative. It's saying that while the movie grows on you, it does so in an unpleasant way, similar to how a rash is unwelcome but maybe something you have to endure.\n\nPutting it together, the sentiment isn't outright negative because it acknowledges growth, but the comparison brings a negative connotation. So overall, I think the sentiment leans more towards negative than positive. It's not extremely negative because there's still some acknowledgment of the movie growing on someone, just in an uncomfortable way.\n\nSo considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative. Since it's slightly negative with a mix of growth but in a bad way, I'd go with 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment is slightly negative due to the unwelcome comparison, despite acknowledging some growth. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 0, 31.842093830986414], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It's talking about \"dogtown and z-boys,\" which I think refers to a specific documentary or group related to skateboarding. The phrase \"more than exposes\" suggests that it reveals something significant beyond just surface information. \n\nThen it mentions the roots of the skateboarding boom, indicating that this is the origin story or history behind the rise of skateboarding. The part in quotes says \"the punk kids' revolution,\" which has a positive and empowering connotation. Revolution often implies something impactful and transformative.\n\nPutting it all together, the text seems to highlight how dogtown and z-boys are crucial in starting the skateboard movement, framing it as a significant cultural shift, especially among punk kids. The use of \"exposes\" and \"roots\" shows an exploration into the origins, which is informative but not necessarily negative or overly positive. However, referring to it as a revolution gives it a positive spin.\n\nSo, considering the options: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The text isn't negative at all; it's more about presenting historical significance and impact.

Let's break down the sentence step by step.\n\nFirst, the text says that \"k-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories.\" The phrase \"will not go down\" suggests that it won't be remembered among the best. That sounds a bit negative because it's pointing out that the movie isn't considered great.\n\nNext, it says, \"but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of man confronting the demons of his own fear and paranoia.\" Here, words like \"engaging,\" \"exciting,\" and describing it as a narrative about confronting fears are positive. These adjectives convey that despite not being one of the greatest submarine stories, the film has its merits.\n\nSo putting it together: The first part is somewhat negative because it's saying the movie isn't memorable in its genre, but then the second part balances it by highlighting the positive aspects of the story and its emotional depth. Therefore, while there's a slight negative start, the overall sentiment leans more positive than negative.\n\nConsidering the scale from 0 to 4, with 0 being very negative and 4 very positive, I think this text is somewhere in between.

It says that after exiting the theater, there's no way one won't be talking about the film. So, it seems like the person is saying that the film was so impactful or interesting that people will inevitably talk about it afterward.\n\nI should consider what kind of sentiment this conveys. If a movie makes people talk about it, it usually means they found it engaging, memorable, or thought-provoking. This could be positive because people are likely to discuss it in a favorable way, or at least with interest.\n\nBut I also need to make sure there's no negative connotation here. The structure of the sentence doesn't imply that talking about the film is a bad thing; instead, it suggests that the film had an effect on the audience. So, without any negative words like \"bad,\" \"horrible,\" or \"disappointing,\" I can assume the sentiment isn't negative.\n\nNow, considering the intensity: the phrase \"no way you won't be talking about\" is quite strong. It implies a high level of certainty that people will talk about it, which suggests a strong positive reaction. So, this isn't just a neutral observation; it's pointing towards a very positive sentiment because the film had such an impact.\n\nI should also think about context. Movies that leave people talking are usually praised for being engaging or thought-provoking. Therefore, the overall feeling here is likely very positive.\n\nPutting it all together: The text expresses a strong positive sentiment because it highlights how memorable and impactful the film was, leading people to discuss it after watching.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is very positive because it indicates that the film was so engaging that people will inevitably talk about it afterward. \n\n4", 4, 3, 36.85945192500367], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence is: \"A depressingly retrograde, `post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women.\" Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me break down the words and phrases here. \"Depressingly\" is a strong negative word\u2014it means something is so bad it's making someone feel depressed. Then \"retrograde\"\u2014that usually refers to going backward or being old-fashioned in a bad way. So that's another negative term.\n\nNext, they mention \"post-feminist.\" I'm not sure if that's positive or negative here. Post-feminist can sometimes imply moving beyond feminism, which might be seen as either progressive or regressive depending on context. But given the rest of the sentence, it seems critical because it's in quotes and part of a negative description.\n\nThe phrase \"takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women\" is definitely negative. Condescending means looking down on someone, so that's disrespectful. The use of \"astonishingly\" emphasizes how surprising and bad this attitude is.\n\nPutting it all together: the text is criticizing a romantic comedy for being old-fashioned and dismissive towards women. Words like \"depressingly,\" \"retrograde,\" and \"condescending\" are strong negatives. So, the sentiment here is very negative.\n\nI should also consider if there's any neutrality or positivity. But no, all parts point towards a negative view. The structure of the sentence is critical without any balancing positive aspects.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses strongly negative language to criticize the romantic comedy for being outdated and condescending towards women, indicating a very negative sentiment.\n\n0", 0, 0, 35.03756015698309], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts by comparing the movie to \"Heathers,\" which is a dark comedy known for its satirical and often bleak tone. So, starting like Heathers could imply some negativity or at least a serious, perhaps edgy beginning.\n\nNext, it says the movie becomes \"Bring It On.\" Bring It On is a high-energy, cheerleading movie that's more upbeat and positive. This shift suggests a change in tone to something more positive or fun.\n\nHowever, the last part of the sentence is where things take a turn: \"then becomes unwatchable.\" The word \"unwatchable\" is very strong and clearly negative. It implies that at some point, the movie became so bad that it's not worth watching anymore. This suggests frustration or disappointment with how the film developed.\n\nPutting this all together: The movie starts with a dark, possibly negative tone (like Heathers), then moves to something more positive (Bring It On), but ultimately becomes unwatchable. So the overall sentiment isn't just about any one part\u2014it's about the progression and especially the ending.\n\nThe key here is the final assessment. Even though there were positive elements in the middle, the movie ended up being \"unwatchable,\" which is a significant negative point. The negative aspect seems to outweigh the positives because it's the culmination of the entire experience.\n\nI should also consider the context of the words used. Words like \"starts out\" and \"then becomes\" show a progression, but the end result is what matters most in determining overall sentiment. Since the ending is so negative, that likely colors the whole review.\n\nSo, evaluating on the scale: 0 is very negative. The movie starts with some dark elements (Heathers), transitions to something positive (Bring It On), but ends up being unwatchable. The strong negative at the end makes me think this should be a 1 or maybe even a 0. But since it started and had some positive, perhaps not the very worst.\n\nWait, but \"unwatchable\" is quite severe. Maybe that's a 0 because it's so bad. However, considering the initial parts were okay, I might lean towards 1 negative instead of 0, which would be very negative. But \"unwatchable\" suggests a strong dislike, so perhaps 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The fact that it starts with Heathers (which is not necessarily all bad) and then becomes positive but ends up unwatchable makes the overall sentiment negative enough to be a 1. But \"unwatchable\" feels more extreme than just negative; perhaps it's a 0.\n\nWait, let me think again: The user has to choose between 0-4, with 0 being very negative. Since \"unwatchable\" is a strong term indicating the movie was so bad that it couldn't be finished or enjoyed at all, maybe this should be classified as 0 (very negative). But I'm not entirely sure because part of the movie had positive elements.\n\nHmm, perhaps the dominant sentiment here is the negativity in the end. So overall, the sentiment leans towards very negative, making it a 0.\n</think>\n\nThe text describes a movie that starts with a dark tone, becomes more positive, but ultimately ends up being unwatchable.

The sentence starts with \"the weird thing,\" which already sets a slightly negative tone because \"weird\" often implies something unexpected or off-putting. Then it mentions Santa Clause 2, supposed to be a children's movie. But the main point is that there's nothing in it to engage children emotionally.\n\nSo, the user is pointing out that despite being labeled as a children's movie, it fails to connect emotionally with its target audience. That's a criticism because engaging emotions is crucial for kids' movies\u2014they need to capture their attention and feel relatable or exciting. The fact that it doesn't do that suggests the movie isn't fulfilling its purpose, which is a negative sentiment.\n\nNow, how strong is this negativity? The words used are \"weird,\" \"purportedly,\" and \"nothing.\" \"Weird\" isn't extremely harsh, but it's still a criticism. \"Purportedly\" implies doubt about the movie being a children's film, and \"nothing to engage emotionally\" directly criticizes its effectiveness.\n\nI don't see any positive words here; everything points towards dissatisfaction or disappointment. So, this is definitely negative. But how intense? Since it's not using strong language like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" maybe it's a 1 (negative) rather than 0 (very negative). However, the criticism is about a fundamental aspect\u2014the emotional engagement\u2014which is crucial for such movies. So perhaps it leans more towards a lower score.\n\nWait, but considering that the user used \"weird thing\" and points out the failure to engage emotionally, which are significant issues, maybe it's stronger than just 1. However, it doesn't use super strong negative adjectives like \"awful\" or \"horrible.\" So I think 1 is appropriate because while it's negative, it's not extremely so.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative.

Finally, comparing the last-minute action to \"Run Lola Run\" might be neutral or slightly positive if they're a fan of that movie, but in this context, it seems like the user found it unoriginal or not well-executed.\n\nOverall, the sentiment is negative because most of the descriptors are critical and express disappointment.

The phrase \"maybe too much\" suggests that while the film is complex, it's possibly overwhelming or overcomplicating things. This seems negative because it implies the movie isn't as good because of having too many elements.\n\nSo putting it together: The first part is neutral/ slightly negative, and the second part is more clearly negative.

The main point seems to be about someone or something being stuck because of a script. The phrase \"they're stuck\" suggests some sort of limitation or hindrance. The word \"catch\" in the beginning also implies that there's a problem or an issue they didn't expect.\n\n\"Firing on all cylinders\" is an idiom meaning to perform at full capacity or maximum efficiency. So, if they can't do that because of this script, it means their performance isn't as good as it could be. This sounds negative because being stuck and not performing well are unfavorable situations.\n\nThe word \"prevents\" is also a strong indicator here\u2014it shows something is stopping them from doing better. There's no positive spin mentioned; the focus is on the limitation caused by the script.\n\nPutting this all together, the sentiment seems clearly negative. But how negative? It's definitely not neutral or positive. Is it very negative (0) or just negative (1)? The language isn't overly harsh, but it does express a significant problem. However, without more extreme words like \"disaster\" or \"failure,\" I think it leans toward being negative rather than very negative.\n\nSo my classification would be 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to the constraints and hindrance mentioned. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 0, 32.04288974800147], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The first part is positive: it talks about having the \"makings of an interesting meditation,\" which suggests potential for depth or thoughtfulness. It mentions the \"ethereal nature\" and \"otherworldly energies,\" which are descriptive terms that could imply something intriguing or profound.\n\nHowever, the second part is more negative. It says the movie \"simply becomes a routine shocker.\" The word \"routine\" implies that it's not particularly original or impactful, just another of its kind without much depth. A \"shocker\" typically refers to something meant to surprise or scare, but in this context, it might mean it doesn't deliver anything new or meaningful beyond that.\n\nSo overall, the sentiment starts positive but ends on a negative note. The first part is somewhat positive with potential, but the second part brings it down by saying it's just a typical horror movie without adding much value. \n\nI need to classify this as 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), or 4 (very positive). The text isn't extremely negative; it acknowledges some potential but ultimately finds the result disappointing.

Let's break down the text: \"weighted down with slow, uninvolving storytelling and flat acting.\"\n\nFirst, looking at the adjectives used: \"slow\" and \"uninvolving\" describe the storytelling as not engaging or moving along quickly. This suggests a lack of interest or dissatisfaction. The term \"flat acting\" refers to poor or unemotional performances by actors, which is another negative aspect.\n\nThe overall phrase uses words that convey a sense of being burdened or hindered (\"weighted down\") by these elements. It's clear the speaker is expressing dissatisfaction with both the pacing and the quality of acting in whatever they're describing\u2014maybe a movie or play.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 is very negative, so does this text qualify? The language used isn't extremely harsh but still conveys a significant negative sentiment. There are no positive elements mentioned; everything points to aspects that are unenjoyable or lacking.\n\nI think it's more than just slightly negative because terms like \"uninvolving\" and \"flat\" strongly criticize the storytelling and acting. It doesn't express extreme anger or frustration, which might push it towards a 0, but it's definitely on the negative side. So maybe a 1 for negative.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes the use of stronger words can indicate more intensity. Here, while the language isn't super harsh, the combination of multiple negatives (\"slow,\" \"uninvolving,\" \"flat\") might make it more than just slightly negative. Maybe I should consider whether it's a 1 or if it could be a 0.\n\nHowever, without explicit strong words like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" it's not extremely negative.

The person is comparing something to \"Rocky and Bullwinkle on speed.\" Rocky and Bullwinkle are known for being humorous and lighthearted, so adding \"on speed\" might mean it's faster-paced but still retains that humor. However, they immediately qualify this comparison by saying it's neither completely enlightening nor does it capture the movie's strangeness.\n\nSo, the first part is a bit positive because Rocky and Bullwinkle are generally liked, but then there's a negative twist with \"neither...nor.\" The person feels that whatever they're describing doesn't meet expectations in two areas: enlightenment and intensity of strangeness. This suggests disappointment or dissatisfaction.\n\nI should consider each part. The comparison is somewhat positive, but the negations (\"neither\" and \"nor\") indicate unmet expectations. The overall tone seems critical because the person is pointing out what it lacks rather than focusing on positives.\n\nPutting this together, the sentiment isn't extremely negative (so not 0), but it's definitely negative because of the dissatisfaction expressed.

Then it describes it as a \"supernatural thriller,\" which is a genre that can be neutral or positive depending on context. But in this case, since it's paired with \"well-done,\" it leans positive.\n\nNext, the phrase \"keen insights into parapsychological phenomena\" suggests that the content is intelligent and thoughtful. Using \"keen\" adds to the positivity here because it means sharp or insightful. \n\nAlso, mentioning \"soulful nuances of the grieving process\" indicates depth and emotional resonance. The word \"soulful\" has a positive connotation, implying something heartfelt or meaningful.\n\nPutting this all together, each part of the sentence is contributing positively.

The word \"best\" clearly indicates something positive. There's no sarcasm or irony indicated in the text, so I can take it at face value. \n\nNext, I'll think about how this compares to other possible sentiments. Since it's using superlative language (\"the best\"), it's not just a neutral statement.

So, if there's nothing redeeming, it means the person found no positives in the movie at all.\n\nThe phrase \"nothing redeeming\" is quite strong. It suggests a complete lack of positive aspects.

Here, \"striking deep chords of sadness\" clearly indicates a strong negative emotion. So, this part is definitely negative.\n\nPutting it all together, the overall sentiment seems to be negative because both parts talk about denial and sadness.

The user wants me to think through how I arrived at my answer, so let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the given text carefully: \"if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about .\" \n\nOkay, so this seems like a suggestion or advice directed towards Damon and Affleck. The phrase \"might try\" suggests that it's a recommendation rather than a direct criticism. They are being advised to shift their focus from the miniseries to the actual film in future projects. \n\nNow, I need to determine if this sentiment is negative, positive, or neutral. Let me dissect the words used here. The sentence doesn't use any explicitly negative or positive adjectives. Words like \"might try\" are neutral; it's not praising them nor condemning their past work. It's more of a constructive suggestion.\n\nThe phrase \"paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film\" implies that maybe in their previous project, they focused too much on the miniseries aspect and perhaps neglected the film part. The advice is pointing out an area where they could improve. \n\nHowever, since it's presented as a suggestion rather than a harsh critique, it doesn't carry strong negative connotations. There's no use of words like \"failed,\" \"disappointing,\" or anything that would indicate frustration or anger. Similarly, there aren't any positive adjectives either; it's more about improvement without overt praise.\n\nSo considering the scale:\n0 - Very Negative\n1 - Negative\n2 - Neutral\n3 - Positive\n4 - Very Positive\n\nThe sentiment here doesn't express a strong emotion in either direction. It's pointing out an area for potential improvement but isn't overly critical or complimentary. Therefore, it seems to fall under neutral sentiment.\n\nI should also consider if there's any hidden tone. Sometimes texts can have an implied negative or positive slant even without explicit language. In this case, the structure is more of a constructive suggestion rather than criticism, so I don't think it leans towards negative. It's simply advising on where to focus next time.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 1, 48.70251116799773], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence given is \"God is great , the movie 's not.\" Hmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst part: \"God is great\" \u2013 that sounds very positive. The word \"great\" is definitely a strong positive adjective. So God being great would make that part really positive. On the scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, this might be a 4.\n\nThen the second part: \"the movie's not.\" This seems like it's saying the movie isn't good or something bad about it. The contraction \"isn't\" is used here, which often conveys a negative sentiment. So this part would likely be negative. Now, how strong is that? It doesn't use any strong words like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" just a simple negation. So maybe that's a 1 on the scale.\n\nNow, putting it all together: The text has two parts with opposite sentiments. How do I weigh them? Since it's one sentence, both parts are equally important. One is very positive and the other is negative. Maybe I should average them or see which part carries more weight.\n\nWait, but in sentiment analysis, sometimes the context matters. Here, \"God is great\" could be a general statement, while the movie comment might be specific. If someone is talking about both God and a movie, it's possible they're contrasting the two. So perhaps their main point is that while God is good, the movie isn't. That would mean the overall sentiment is more on the negative side because the focus is on the movie being not great.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider each part separately, \"God is great\" is a strong positive (4) and \"the movie's not\" is a weak negative (1). If I average them, (4 + 1)/2 = 2.5, which would round to 3 or maybe 2. But since it's one sentence combining both, the sentiment might lean towards neutral because there are positive and negative elements balancing each other out.\n\nWait, but in the original response, they gave a score of 2. That makes sense as neutral because it's mixing a strong positive with a mild negative. Maybe that's why.\n</think>\n\nThe text contains two contrasting sentiments: a strong positive about God and a mild negative about the movie.

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe sentence is: \"perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , about schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness.\"\n\nHmm, first, I notice words like \"perfectly pitched,\" which sounds positive. It's describing something as well-balanced. Then it mentions being \"far closer than many movies\" in expressing a certain truth about life, which seems complimentary.\n\nThe phrase \"expressing the way many of us live\" suggests authenticity and relatability, which is usually a good thing. The part after the dash talks about living between self-absorption and otherness, but that's more about describing a state rather than having an overtly positive or negative sentiment.\n\nOverall, the language used seems appreciative without any strong negative words. So I think it leans towards positive but not extremely so. Maybe a 3 for positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses complimentary terms like \"perfectly pitched\" and highlights relatability and authenticity, indicating a positive sentiment. However, it doesn't use overly enthusiastic language. \n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. The phrase \"perfectly pitched\" suggests balance and excellence.\n2.

This balanced perspective might lean towards neutral.\n\nNext, comparing it to Wiseman's other studies adds context. His previous works were on various public institutions, which can have both positive and negative aspects. If this text is being compared favorably, it could mean the sentiment isn't overly positive or negative.\n\nI don't see any strong positive adjectives like \"excellent\" or \"wonderful,\" nor are there strongly negative words like \"terrible\" or \"disappointing.\" The overall tone seems objective and analytical rather than emotionally charged. \n\nSo, considering these points, the sentiment is likely neutral.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 2, 20.50655211499543], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at \"preachy parable.\" Preachy can sometimes have a negative connotation because it might imply that something is overly moralistic or repetitive in its messaging. A parable itself is just a story with a lesson, so maybe not inherently positive or negative on its own.\n\nThen there's \"stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet.\" Now, John Woo is known for his action movies and the term \"bullet ballet\" refers to his signature style where gunfights are choreographed like dances. That's usually seen as very cool and stylish, which would be positive.\n\nSo putting it together: The text mentions something that might feel a bit on-the-nose with its message but is made visually impressive. So does the negative aspect of \"preachy\" outweigh the positive from the styling? Or vice versa?\n\nI think since bullet ballet is a well-regarded style, even if the story feels preachy, the overall sentiment might lean towards neutral or slightly positive because the visual style adds value. Maybe the user isn't overly impressed by the storytelling but appreciates the technical execution.\n\nSo on the scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive), I'm thinking it's around a 2 or maybe a 3. But considering \"preachy\" might have a slight negative impact, perhaps a 2 is more accurate as neutral.\n</think>\n\nThe text combines elements of a preachy parable with the stylish action of John Woo's bullet ballet. While \"preachy\" could imply a slightly negative connotation due to its moralistic tone, the mention of John Woo's signature style adds a positive aspect. Balancing these elements leans towards a neutral sentiment.\n\n2", 2, 2, 37.096947176993126], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the sentence is saying. The phrase \"the name says it all\" is pretty common. It usually means that the name alone captures everything about something\u2014like a product, a place, or an event. So, if someone uses this phrase, they're likely making a point about how descriptive or accurate the name is.\n\nNow, I should think about the context where such a statement might be used. Sometimes people use it positively when the name perfectly describes something good. For example, \"The Best Burger Place Ever\" as a restaurant's name would make sense if their burgers are amazing. In that case, using this phrase could imply satisfaction or praise.\n\nOn the flip side, someone might say this in a negative context too. Imagine a store named \"Budget Busters\"\u2014if the prices are actually very high, someone might say, \"The name says it all,\" implying that the name accurately reflects their bad experience with overpriced items.\n\nBut without any additional context, I have to rely on the phrase itself. The sentence doesn't include any explicitly positive or negative words. It's more of a neutral observation about the name being descriptive. However, the way it's phrased could be interpreted as either positive or negative depending on what the name represents.\n\nWait, but since there's no context given here, I have to go with the most straightforward interpretation. The phrase doesn't inherently carry a positive or negative charge; it's more about the name being descriptive. Therefore, in this case, the sentiment is neutral.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the sentiment of \"the name says it all.\" is neutral.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 2, 37.67483544899733], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The example given is \"sweetly sexy, funny and touching.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each word in the phrase. \"Sweetly\" has a positive connotation, suggesting something pleasant or endearing. Then \"sexy\" can be subjective, but in many contexts, it's used positively, especially when paired with \"sweetly,\" which softens it. \n\nNext is \"funny,\" which is clearly a positive descriptor as humor is generally well-received. Lastly, \"touching\" usually implies something that evokes emotion, often positive or at least heartfelt.\n\nPutting these together: all the words are on the positive side. There's no negative language here. The text seems to be expressing appreciation for something that combines sensuality, humor, and emotional depth. \n\nNow, considering the scale from 0 to 4, where 2 is neutral. Since all descriptors are positive but not extremely so, I think it's more than just a little positive (which might be a 3) but not extremely high (like a 4). Wait, no, actually, each word contributes a positive aspect without any negatives. So maybe it's a solid 3.\n\nWait, could it be higher? If all aspects are positive and nothing negative, does that make it very positive? Or is \"touching\" just moderately positive? I think in this case, since there are multiple positive adjectives, the sentiment leans towards being quite positive but not extremely so. So maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nBut considering each word individually: \"sweetly sexy\" could be seen as a mix of soft and intense, but both positive. \"Funny\" is definitely positive, and \"touching\" adds emotional depth without any negativity. So overall, the sentiment is positive but not extremely so. Maybe I'll go with 3 as it's more than neutral but not the highest possible.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 4, 41.770652387989685], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The words used here are strong negatives like \"unthinkable,\" \"unacceptable,\" and \"unmentionable.\" These terms usually have negative connotations because they refer to things that are too horrible or inappropriate to talk about.\n\nBut wait, is the sentiment actually negative? Or could it be interpreted differently? Maybe Solondz is being praised for confronting these issues head-on. The phrase \"forces us to consider\" might imply a positive action in making people face important but uncomfortable truths. So even though the content is negative, the act of bringing these things into discussion could be seen as a positive step.\n\nI think the overall sentiment here leans towards positive because it's about confronting hard realities, which can lead to greater awareness or change.

The phrase starts with \"boasts,\" which is generally positive because it means something impressive or admirable. Then there's \"a handful of virtuosic set pieces\"\u2014\"virtuosic\" means highly skilled or masterly, so that's a strong positive adjective. \n\nNext part: \"offers a fair amount of trashy, kinky fun.\" Now, \"trashy\" can be tricky because it usually has a negative connotation, implying something low-quality or vulgar. However, when followed by \"fun,\" it might be used in a more playful way. Similarly, \"kinky\" is often associated with unconventional or risqu\u00e9 content, which could be seen as positive if the context appreciates such elements.\n\nPutting it together, the sentence seems to highlight both impressive aspects and some fun, albeit perhaps not overly refined, elements. The use of positive words like \"boasts,\" \"virtuosic,\" and \"fun\" suggests an overall positive sentiment, but the presence of \"trashy\" and \"kinky\" might temper that positivity a bit.\n\nConsidering the scale, 4 is very positive, which seems too high because there are some negative descriptors. A neutral score of 2 doesn't fit well since the positives outweigh the negatives. So between 3 (positive) and maybe 1 or 2.

It starts with \"but,\" which can sometimes indicate a contrast or a change in direction. But the key part here is \"is thought-provoking.\" Thought-provoking generally means something that makes you think deeply or consider different ideas. That's usually seen as a positive trait because it suggests engagement and intellectual stimulation.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider the overall context. The sentence could be reacting to something someone else is doing. So if they're doing something thought-provoking, does that mean it's a good thing? Well, thought-provoking isn't inherently negative or positive on its own\u2014it depends on what they're doing. But in most cases, being thought-provoking is viewed favorably because it can lead to new insights or discussions.\n\nThe word \"but\" at the beginning might be setting up a contrast, but without more context, I don't know what it's contrasting against. So I shouldn't assume it's negative unless there are other clues. Since there aren't any explicitly positive or negative words beyond \"thought-provoking,\" which is generally neutral to slightly positive.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment here seems mostly neutral with a slight lean towards positive because thought-provoking suggests something engaging.

They are described as \"reveling,\" which means they're enjoying something a lot. The next part talks about \"visual in-jokes,\" so these are inside jokes that people familiar with cinema would appreciate.\n\nThen, it mentions the film's \"verbal pokes at everything from Harvey Weinstein's bluff personal style to Denmark's Dogma movement.\" \"Verbal pokes\" could mean subtle criticisms or humorous jabs. So, the film is making fun of or pointing out things about these subjects.\n\nNow, I have to figure out if this sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The use of \"reveling\" and \"in-jokes\" suggests that the audience (cineasts) are finding enjoyment in these elements. However, the part about poking at Harvey Weinstein's style could be seen as critical or mocking. But since it's framed as something cineasts would appreciate, maybe it's more about the cleverness of the film rather than being outright negative.\n\nHarvey Weinstein was involved in some controversies, so mentioning his \"bluff personal style\" might be highlighting that aspect in a critical way, but again, within the context of the film and for cineasts, this could be seen as insightful or satirical rather than purely negative. Similarly, the Dogma movement's stylistic rigor is being poked at, which might be pointing out their strictness in a humorous manner.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment seems positive because the text highlights that cineasts are enjoying these elements, suggesting the film is clever and engaging.

The sentence says: \"the story has its redundancies, and the young actors, not very experienced, are sometimes inexpressive.\"\n\nFirst, looking at the words used. \"Redundancies\" usually means unnecessary repetition, which isn't great. So that's a bit negative. Then it mentions the young actors aren't very experienced and can be inexpressive. Inexpressive probably means they don't show emotions well, so their acting might be flat or not engaging.\n\nPutting that together, both parts are pointing out flaws: one about the story being redundant and another about the actors' lack of experience leading to poor expressions. This makes the sentiment more negative than positive. But how strong is this negativity?\n\nThe text doesn't use very harsh words; it's more like a mild criticism.

It mentions \"has fun with the quirks of family life,\" which sounds positive because finding fun in something indicates enjoyment or a good experience. The word \"fun\" is definitely a positive term here.\n\nThen it says, \"but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect.\" The words \"fondness\" and \"respect\" are both positive emotions. Fondness suggests warmth and affection, while respect shows admiration or consideration. These are strong indicators of a positive sentiment.\n\nPutting it together, the text is talking about something (maybe a show, movie, book) that not only finds enjoyment in family life's peculiarities but also approaches the subject matter with care and esteem. There's no negative language here\u2014no complaints, criticism, or disappointment. Everything points towards positivity.\n\nI don't see any neutral elements either because words like \"fun,\" \"fondness,\" and \"respect\" are all clearly positive. It doesn't seem to be on the fence; it's actively expressing favorable feelings about family life.\n\nSo considering the scale, 0 is very negative, which isn't the case here. 1 is negative, but again, there's nothing negative. Neutral would be 2, but this text is definitely leaning positive. Between 3 and 4, I think since all aspects are positive without any superlatives or extreme language, it's a solid positive. Maybe not the most extremely positive, so perhaps 3? Or maybe because of \"fun\" and both \"fondness\" and \"respect,\" it could be a 4.\n\nWait, but 4 is very positive. The text doesn't use superlatives like \"excellent\" or \"wonderful.\" It's more moderate in its positivity. So perhaps 3 is the right choice because while it's definitely positive, it's not using extremely strong language.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is positive due to words like \"fun,\" \"fondness,\" and \"respect.\" These indicate a favorable view without extreme language. \n\nAnswer: 3", 3, 4, 49.75208321897662], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The kids were bored during the preview. They only cheered for pratfalls (which are usually funny or slapstick moments) and not much else. That suggests the movie wasn't engaging enough for them beyond those basic elements.\n\nThen there's a contrast with the parents, who are described as \"wise folks\" reading books instead of paying attention to the screening. This implies that even the adults weren't particularly engaged or impressed by the film. The use of \"wise\" might carry a slightly positive connotation about the parents, but in this context, it seems more like they're not distracted by the movie and are doing something else.\n\nPutting it together, the overall sentiment is negative because both kids and parents aren't fully engaged with the screening. However, it's not extremely negative; there's no strong language or intense criticism.

The user has provided a sentence: \"just about the surest bet for an all-around good time at the movies this summer.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the words and their implications. The phrase starts with \"just about,\" which usually means something is almost true but not entirely. Then there's \"the surest bet,\" which implies a high level of confidence or certainty. So, putting that together, it seems like the speaker is saying this movie is almost certainly going to be good.\n\nNext, the phrase \"all-around good time\" clearly indicates a positive experience. \"All-around\" suggests that every aspect contributes positively, and \"good time\" is straightforwardly positive. Finally, the context is about movies during summer, which often has a fun connotation for many people.\n\nConsidering all these elements, the sentiment here seems very positive. The use of words like \"surest bet,\" \"all-around good time,\" and the overall enthusiastic tone point towards a high level of positivity. There's no negative language used, so it can't be anything below neutral. It's definitely not just positive (3) but goes beyond that to being very positive because of the strong confidence expressed in it being a sure bet for a good time.\n\nI don't think it's neutral because the text is clearly expressing a positive opinion without any ambiguity. So, putting this all together, I would classify this sentiment as 4, which stands for very positive.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence expresses a high level of enthusiasm and confidence in recommending the movie experience, using strong positive language.\n\n4", 4, 4, 33.80187173100421], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user has provided the text: \"less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession.\" I need to determine if it's 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), or 4 (very positive).\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. It starts by saying it's \"less\" about madness or love, which are typically intense emotions. Madness can have negative connotations, while love is generally positive but here seems to be diminished. The phrase \"than a study in schoolgirl obsession\" shifts focus to something else.\n\nNow, what does \"schoolgirl obsession\" imply? It could suggest infatuation, perhaps bordering on idol worship or fixation, which isn't inherently negative but can carry undertones of naivety or excessive attention. The comparison here might be somewhat critical, implying that the subject is more about this obsession than deeper themes like madness or love.\n\nLooking at the overall tone, it's not overtly positive or negative. It's comparing two concepts without explicitly praising or condemning them. The use of \"less\" and \"than\" creates a balanced view rather than leaning heavily in one direction. Therefore, the sentiment doesn't seem extremely negative or very positive.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 is very negative, which isn't the case here. 1 is negative, but there's no clear negativity beyond a possible critique of superficiality. On the flip side, it's not positive enough to warrant a 3 or 4. So, neutral (2) seems appropriate because the statement doesn't express strong emotion but rather an analytical comparison.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence compares two themes and suggests that the focus is more on schoolgirl obsession than madness or love.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the words used here. The sentence talks about the plot's contrivances being \"uncomfortably strained.\" Contrivances in a plot usually refer to devices or elements that are artificially constructed to move the story forward. Now, when someone describes these as \"strained,\" it suggests that they feel forced or unnatural.\n\nThe word \"uncomfortably\" adds an intensity here. It's not just that the contrivances are strained; they're so much so that it causes discomfort. This makes me think the speaker is expressing frustration or dissatisfaction with how the plot elements are handled.\n\nPutting this together, the sentiment seems negative because the speaker is pointing out a flaw in the storytelling\u2014specifically, that the plot relies too heavily on unnatural devices. However, I need to determine just how negative it is. The phrase isn't extremely harsh; there's no use of words like \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" It's more about something being strained and uncomfortable.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 is very negative, which might be reserved for stronger negative sentiments. This doesn't quite reach that level because while it's a criticism, it's not as intense. So I'm leaning towards 1, which represents a negative sentiment but not the most extreme one.\n\nI should also think about whether this could be neutral. Neutral would mean no strong emotion, just stating facts without opinion. But here, the use of \"uncomfortably strained\" clearly conveys a negative feeling about how the plot is constructed.\n\nSo, after considering all these points, I believe the sentiment is negative but not extremely so. Therefore, the appropriate score would be 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence criticizes the plot's contrivances as being overly forced and uncomfortable, indicating a negative sentiment that isn't extremely harsh. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 41.39411258301698], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user provided two sentences: \"the script has less spice than a rat burger\" and \"the rock's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal.\" \n\nFirst, looking at the first sentence. Comparing the script to having less spice than a rat burger is clearly negative. Rat burgers aren't something desirable, so implying the script lacks flavor or excitement is a criticism.\n\nNext, the second part talks about The Rock's fighting skills being like Steven Seagal's. I know that while both are action stars, Steven Seagal has been criticized for his less-than-realistic fight scenes. So this comparison might be meant to say that The Rock's skills aren't great either, which is another negative point.\n\nPutting it together, the user is expressing dissatisfaction with both the script and The Rock's performance. However, the language isn't extremely harsh; it's more of a mild criticism rather than something very negative. \n\nSo on the scale from 0 to 4, I'd rate this as 1\u2014negative but not extremely so.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed is negative due to the critical comparisons made about both the script and The Rock's fighting skills.\n\n1", 1, 1, 25.231622846011305], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence is: \"Perhaps not since Nelson Eddy crooned his Indian Love Call to Jeanette MacDonald has there been a movie so unabashedly Canadian, not afraid to risk American scorn or disinterest.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components. The mention of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald is likely referencing a specific movie, probably from the 1930s. \"Crooned\" means singing in a soft, pleasant voice, so that's positive.\n\nThe main part talks about a movie being \"unabashedly Canadian.\" That suggests pride in being Canadian without hiding it, which is positive. The phrase \"not afraid to risk American scorn or disinterest\" implies that the movie takes a bold stance by staying true to its Canadian roots even if Americans don't like it. This could be seen as a compliment because it values authenticity over trying to appeal universally.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment seems positive.

The user wants me to classify it as 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), or 4 (very positive). Let's break down what each part of the sentence says.\n\nFirst, \"I thought the relationships were wonderful.\" The word \"wonderful\" is a strong positive adjective. That's definitely a plus point towards positivity.\n\nNext, \"the comedy was funny.\" Again, \"funny\" is a positive descriptor when talking about comedy. It suggests that the humor was effective and enjoyable.\n\nLastly, \"and the love `real`.\" The quotes around real might indicate emphasis on how genuine the love felt. Real can sometimes be neutral, but in this context, it's likely reinforcing that the love portrayed was believable and heartfelt, which is a positive aspect.\n\nPutting it all together: all three parts of the sentence are positive. \"Wonderful,\" \"funny,\" and \"real\" (as genuine) each contribute to an overall positive sentiment. There's nothing negative mentioned here. So, considering the scale from 0 to 4, where 4 is very positive, this text should be a 3 or 4.\n\nBut wait, does it reach \"very positive\"? The adjectives used are strong but not superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"incredible.\" It's more on the positive side without being overly effusive. So maybe a 3 for positive rather than 4.\n\nAlternatively, since all aspects are praised and no negative points are present, it might lean towards 4. However, I think \"wonderful\" is quite strong, so perhaps it's a solid 3.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses predominantly positive sentiments with strong adjectives like \"wonderful\" and \"funny,\" but doesn't reach the level of being very positive.\n\n3", 3, 4, 39.899459847976686], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence is: \"It stars schticky Chris Rock and stolid Anthony Hopkins, who seem barely in the same movie.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the words used here. \"Schticky\" means someone is trying too hard to be funny, maybe even annoyingly so. \"Stolid\" describes someone as serious or unemotional, almost like they're not reacting much. The phrase \"seem barely in the same movie\" suggests that their performances don't mesh well together.\n\nPutting this all together, it sounds like a negative review. They're criticizing both actors' styles and implying that they don't complement each other. The overall tone is critical, so I think the sentiment is negative but not extremely so. \n\nSo, on the scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, this should probably be a 1 because it's definitely negative but not overly harsh.\n</think>\n\nThe text critiques both actors' performances as incompatible and describes them negatively, indicating an overall negative sentiment.\n\n1", 1, 1, 23.25505163599155], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence is: \"This is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are, and how to push them.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the words used. The word \"harrowing\" stands out to me because it means something that's causing great anxiety or distress. So right away, this gives the sentence a negative connotation. It suggests that the movie is emotionally intense or disturbing.\n\nNext, looking at the rest of the sentence: \"about how parents know where all the buttons are, and how to push them.\" This part implies that the parents in the movie are manipulating others by knowing their weaknesses or emotional triggers. The act of pushing someone's buttons can be seen as controlling or hurtful, which adds to the negative sentiment.\n\nPutting it together, the sentence describes a movie that is harrowing because it deals with manipulative parenting. This isn't just a neutral observation; it's pointing out something unpleasant about the film. So while the sentiment isn't entirely void of any positive aspects (since it's talking about parents knowing their children well), the overall tone leans negative due to the use of \"harrowing\" and the implication of manipulation.\n\nI also need to consider if there are any other words that might tip the scale more towards neutrality or positivity. But in this case, both parts of the sentence contribute a negative feel. There's no mention of anything positive about the movie, just its intensity and the manipulative nature portrayed.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this sentiment as negative but not extremely so. Since 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, and the options go up from there, I think it fits best at 1 because while it's clearly negative, it doesn't use extremely strong negative language beyond \"harrowing.\"\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is classified as 1 (negative) due to the use of the term \"harrowing\" and the implication of manipulative behavior.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 2, 44.34584361099405], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is: \"if a few good men told us that we `` can't handle the truth '' than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we `` don't care about the truth . ''\"\n\nFirst, let me break it down. It's comparing two movies: \"A Few Good Men\" and \"High Crimes.\" In the first, they say people can't handle the truth, which is a quote from that movie. Then, in \"High Crimes,\" they say people don't care about the truth. \n\nSo, both statements are negative towards people's relationship with the truth. The first suggests inability to handle it, and the second says people don't care about it at all. That seems pretty negative overall.\n\nNow, considering sentiment scores from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). Both quotes are critical of how people approach the truth, which is a negative view. So I should rate this as either 0 or 1. Since both movies are highlighting a lack in people's regard for the truth, it seems very negative.\n\nI don't see any positive elements here; the focus is on the negative aspects of people not caring about the truth and being unable to handle it.

The user provided a sentence: \"be forewarned, if you're depressed about anything before watching this film, you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards.\" Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me break it down. The phrase starts with \"be forewarned,\" which is like a warning. So someone is advising others about something negative that might happen after watching the film. Then they say if you're already feeling depressed before watching, you could end up wanting to drown yourself afterward. That sounds really severe.\n\nSo the sentiment here isn't just neutral or slightly negative; it's pointing out that the movie has a strong negative effect on someone who's already down. The example given is extreme\u2014trying to drown oneself\u2014which indicates a very negative reaction.\n\nI should consider the scale: 0 is very negative, 4 is very positive. Since this is advising against watching the film due to its potential to worsen one's mood severely, it's definitely on the negative side. Maybe even more than just negative because of the extreme example used. So probably a 0 or 1.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overthinking. The main point is that the sentiment expressed is very negative because it warns of making someone who's already depressed feel worse. Therefore, the sentiment score should be 0 for very negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text conveys a strong warning about the film's potential to negatively affect someone's mental state, using an extreme example.

Then \"chronicle\" just means a record of events, so it's neutral on its own. Next, \"money grubbing\" refers to people obsessed with making money in a negative way, often implying greed. \n\nMoving on, \"New Yorkers\" is neutral as it's just referring to people from NYC. But the combination with \"money grubbing\" gives it a negative connotation. Then there's \"serial loveless hook ups.\" \"Loveless\" clearly indicates a lack of emotional connection, which is negative, and \"hook ups\" are casual encounters. So overall, this part describes people having repeated casual, emotionally empty relationships.\n\nPutting it all together, the text uses several negative adjectives: anemic, money grubbing, loveless. These words paint a bleak picture of both financial obsession and emotional emptiness among New Yorkers. There's no positive language here; everything is pointing towards negative traits and situations.\n\nSo considering the scale from 0 to 4, with 0 being very negative, I think this sentiment falls into that category.

The first part says that as an actor's showcase, the film has a lot going for it. That sounds positive because \"much to recommend\" suggests it's good or worth watching.\n\nThe second part mentions that while the top-billed actor, Willis, isn't the most impressive. This is somewhat negative but not overly so. It's pointing out a weakness but in a balanced way.\n\nPutting these together, the overall sentiment seems mixed. The positive aspect about the film as an actor's showcase leans it towards being favorable, but the slight criticism of the lead actor keeps it from being extremely positive. \n\nSo, on the scale given, 0 is very negative, 4 is very positive. This text isn't too harsh in its critique, so I don't think it's a 0 or even a 1. It's not neutral either because there's an overall recommendation.

The user wants it to be one of the integers from 0 to 4, where each number represents the level of negativity or positivity. Let me start by reading the text carefully.\n\nThe text is: \"this is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The first part says \"visually stunning,\" which immediately makes me think positive because \"stunning\" is a strong positive adjective. So that's a good point towards positivity.\n\nNext, it mentions \"rumination on love.\" Ruminate can sometimes have a neutral or slightly negative connotation, but when paired with love, which is generally a positive topic, I don't see any negativity here. It sounds like the text is thoughtfully considering love, which is a positive theme.\n\nThen there's \"memory,\" which is more neutral. Memory can be good or bad depending on context, but without more information, it doesn't lean either way. So that's probably neutral.\n\n\"History\" is also neutral on its own; it depends on how history is portrayed. Again, no clear sentiment here unless specified otherwise.\n\nFinally, \"the war between art and commerce.\" The word \"war\" suggests conflict or struggle. Art is often seen as a positive pursuit, while commerce can sometimes be viewed negatively when it conflicts with artistic integrity. So this part might carry a slightly negative connotation because of the tension implied by the word \"war.\"\n\nPutting it all together: \"visually stunning\" is very positive. The other elements like love and memory are neutral or positive, but the mention of war introduces some negativity. However, since \"visually stunning\" is such a strong positive descriptor, it likely outweighs the slight negative from the conflict between art and commerce.\n\nI need to assign this a score from 0 to 4. Since there's a mix, but the overall tone leans more positive because of the visual aspect, I think it should be on the higher end. But is it a 3 (positive) or a 4 (very positive)? The presence of \"war\" might prevent it from being a 4. So maybe a 3 is appropriate here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that \"visually stunning\" is very strong and the rest are either neutral or have minor negatives, perhaps a 4 isn't too far off. But since there's an element of conflict mentioned, I'll go with a 3 as it's still positive but not extremely so.\n</think>\n\nThe text has a positive sentiment due to the \"visually stunning\" descriptor, despite mentioning a conflict between art and commerce.\n\n3", 3, 3, 56.35005795399775], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts with \"a fake street drama,\" which already has some negative connotations because using \"fake\" suggests it's not genuine or authentic. That makes me think the speaker doesn't have a high opinion of whatever they're talking about\u2014maybe a movie or a show.\n\nThen it says, \"that keeps telling you things instead of showing them.\" This part is pointing out that the drama tells the audience information rather than showing it through actions or visuals. In storytelling, especially in movies and TV shows, showing is usually preferred over telling because it's more engaging and immersive. So if this street drama is just telling the story without showing, it might be considered less effective or boring.\n\nPutting it together, both parts of the sentence have negative implications. The first part calls it fake, and the second criticizes its storytelling method. There are no positive words here; everything points towards dissatisfaction or criticism.\n\nNow, considering the scale from 0 to 4: 0 is very negative, which might be too harsh for this text because while it's negative, it doesn't use extremely strong language like \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" It just says \"fake\" and criticizes the storytelling. So maybe a 1 would fit better as a negative sentiment.\n\nI don't see any neutral elements here\u2014every part of the sentence is expressing dissatisfaction. There's no balance between positive and negative; it's all negative. Therefore, assigning a neutral score (2) wouldn't be accurate.\n\nIs there a chance it could be more negative? Maybe if it had stronger words like \"awful\" or \"terrible,\" but as it stands, \"fake\" and the critique of storytelling are both negative but not extremely so. So 1 seems appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to the use of the word \"fake\" and the criticism of the storytelling method.

Let me break down the sentence: \"it's good, hard-edged stuff, violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done, morally alert and street-smart.\"\n\nFirst, I notice words like \"good\" which is clearly positive. Then \"hard-edged\" might be neutral or slightly negative depending on context. Next, \"violent and a bit exploitative\" \u2013 these are definitely negative terms. However, the sentence continues with \"nicely done,\" which is another positive phrase. The last part, \"morally alert and street-smart,\" adds more positivity.\n\nSo there's a mix here. Negative aspects like violence and exploitation but balanced by positive descriptors such as good, nicely done, morally aware. I think overall it leans towards positive because the negatives are tempered with positives. But since there are some negative elements, it might not be extremely positive (which would be 4). So probably a 3.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment of the text is positive but has some negative aspects that prevent it from being very positive.

But then it's paired with \"grim,\" which is definitely negative\u2014it gives a dark or serious feel. So there are mixed signals here.\n\nThe subject is about hookers and their thoughts on themselves and clients. That could be seen as neutral because it's just describing the content without clear emotion. However, using \"grim\" might lean towards a more negative sentiment because it suggests something unpleasant or difficult.\n\nPutting it all together, the text presents an engaging yet somber look at the subject. The positive adjective \"engrossing\" is balanced by the negative \"grim.\" Since there's both but maybe leaning slightly negative due to the grim tone, I think it's neutral overall but not strongly so.

The text is: \"the picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it 's no glance.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the sentence. \"The picture runs a mere 84 minutes\" \u2013 this seems to be talking about the length of a movie. Using \"mere\" could imply that the runtime is short, maybe suggesting that it's not very long. Depending on context, \"mere\" can sometimes have a slightly negative connotation, implying something isn't as much as expected or needed.\n\nNext part: \"but it 's no glance.\" The phrase \"no glance\" isn't immediately clear to me. Maybe it's a typo? Perhaps they meant \"no glance,\" but I think the intended meaning is that it's not just a quick look or that it requires more attention than a simple glance. Alternatively, if it was \"not glanced over,\" maybe implying that it's worth paying attention to.\n\nPutting it together: The movie is short (84 minutes) but isn't something you can just glance at; it needs more focus or has depth. So, the sentiment here might be positive because the reviewer is saying despite its short length, it's meaningful or not superficial.\n\nAlternatively, if \"mere\" is used in a negative way, maybe implying that 84 minutes isn't enough, but the second part contradicts that by saying it's not just a glance. So overall, the sentiment seems more positive because they're emphasizing that even though it's short, it's substantial.\n</think>\n\nThe text mentions the movie's short runtime but highlights its depth, indicating a positive sentiment.\n\n3", 3, 3, 38.26475746699725], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts with \"often likable,\" which sounds positive. That suggests that sometimes the subject is enjoyable or pleasant. However, the second part of the sentence uses \"but just as often\" which introduces a contrast. The rest of the sentence describes negative aspects: meandering (which can mean unfocused), low on energy (lacking vitality), and too eager to be quirky at moments when old-fashioned storytelling would have been better.\n\nSo there's both positive and negative elements here. The positive is that it's likable, but the negatives are more prominent with words like meandering, low energy, and overly quirky. The sentence seems to balance between these two aspects but leans towards the negative because of the critical points made about the storytelling approach not being effective.\n\nThe sentiment isn't extremely negative because there's a positive element mentioned initially. It's also not neutral because while both sides are presented, the negatives seem more emphasized. On the scale provided, 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive.

The beginning says, \"the first hour is tedious.\" The word \"tedious\" is negative, indicating that the initial portion of the movie was boring or slow.\n\n2. Then it adds, \"though ford and neeson capably hold our interest.\" Here, \"capably hold our interest\" suggests a positive aspect because Ford and Neeson are able to keep the audience engaged despite the tedious start.\n\n3. The next part is, \"but its just not a thrilling movie.\" The word \"thrilling\" is being negated with \"not,\" so this is negative. It means the movie doesn't deliver excitement as expected.\n\nPutting it all together: There's a mix of negative and positive elements here. The first hour is tedious (negative), but the actors manage to keep interest (positive). However, overall, it's not thrilling (negative).\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 4 is very positive. So how does this balance?\n\nThe text starts with a negative point, then a positive one, and ends on another negative note. The positives are about holding interest despite the tedium, but the overall sentiment seems to lean towards negative because it's not thrilling.\n\nSo I'd rate this as either 1 (negative) or maybe 2 (neutral). But since the first hour is tedious and it's not thrilling, even though the actors help, the overall feeling leans more negative than neutral.

The sentence is: \"Though it inspires some (out-of-field) creative thought, the film is \u2014 to its own detriment \u2014 much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract.\" \n\nLet me break it down. First part says the film inspires some creative thought, especially from an out-of-field perspective. That sounds positive because inspiring creativity is usually seen as a good thing.\n\nBut then it changes. The film is \"much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract.\" I think a cinematic collage might be mixing various elements without a clear message, while a polemical tract is something that has a strong argument or point of view. So by saying the film isn't the latter, it's implying that maybe it's not as impactful or focused.\n\nThe phrase \"to its own detriment\" really stands out. That means whatever follows is seen as a disadvantage to the film. So, while there's some positive in inspiring creativity, the overall assessment seems negative because the film fails to achieve what it was probably aiming for\u2014being a polemical tract with a clear message.\n\nPutting this together: There's a mix of a slight positive and a stronger negative. The negative part is about the film's structure being more like a collage, which is not as effective. So I think the sentiment leans towards negative but isn't extremely so.

The phrase \"isn't that much different\" suggests a similarity but maybe not entirely the same.\n\nNow, thinking about sentiment, this statement doesn't seem overly positive or negative. It's more of an observation or comparison. There's no strong emotion expressed here; instead, it's stating that Frida is somewhat similar to typical Hollywood romances. \n\nI should consider if there are any implied sentiments. Sometimes comparisons can carry undertones. For example, if someone says a movie isn't much different from others, it could imply it's predictable or lacks originality, which might be slightly negative. However, the wording here uses \"isn't that much\" which is somewhat neutral in its phrasing. It doesn't explicitly say it's good or bad, just similar.\n\nAlso, considering the context of the sentence, without any additional information about what the person thinks of Hollywood romances, we can't infer if they think positively or negatively about them. So, it's hard to assign a strong sentiment based solely on this statement.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, I think the sentiment is neutral because there are no clear positive or negative words used, just an observational comparison.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 1, 33.861791267001536], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The word \"lacks\" immediately stands out as a negative term. It suggests that Russell doesn't have certain qualities. Then, there are three specific things mentioned: visual panache, comic touch, and budget.\n\nVisual panache refers to style or flair in visuals. If someone lacks it, they're not impressing visually. Comic touch means they aren't funny or engaging in a humorous way. Budget issues could imply that the production isn't as good because of financial constraints.\n\nEach of these points is pointing out a deficiency. So overall, the sentiment seems negative because it's highlighting what Russell doesn't have. But how strong is this negativity?\n\nIt's not extremely harsh; the words used are somewhat objective terms rather than emotional exclamations. It's more of a critique than a rant. Therefore, I think it leans towards a 1 (negative) rather than 0 (very negative).

It suggests that something is intense or engaging in a way that captures attention. In most contexts, when someone describes a drama as gripping, they mean it's compelling and holds the viewer's interest effectively.\n\nNow, considering sentiment analysis, positive words are those that convey satisfaction, approval, or happiness. \"Gripping\" falls into this category because it implies that the drama is well-made and has an emotional impact. It doesn't express any negative feelings; instead, it highlights the positive aspects of the drama's quality.\n\nLooking at the options provided, 4 is very positive, 3 is positive. Since \"gripping\" is a strong compliment but might not be as extreme as words that denote absolute perfection or euphoria, I'm leaning towards 3. It's definitely positive without being overly hyperbolic.\n\nI don't think it's neutral because there's no ambiguity in the statement\u2014it's clearly expressing approval.

The first part mentions that Soderbergh puts psychological and philosophical content in italics instead of trusting the audience's intelligence. Using italics might indicate a narrative style choice, but the way it's phrased suggests criticism. It implies that he doesn't trust his audience, which could be seen as a negative point.\n\nThe second part says he creates an overall sense of brusqueness. Brusque means abrupt or rough in manner, so this is another negative trait being attributed to Soderbergh's work. \n\nPutting it together, both points are critical of how Soderbergh handles his material and the impact on the audience. There's no positive language here; instead, there's a sense that his approach is off-putting or dismissive of the audience.\n\nI need to decide on the sentiment score. Since both aspects are negative but not extremely so, it's more than just slightly negative (which would be 1), but not extremely negative either.

It's talking about Spider-Man, but not in a way that seems particularly emotional or positive. The phrases used are a bit unusual for describing the character. \"Growing strange hairs\" sounds like something from a body horror movie rather than a superhero origin story. Then it mentions getting a more mature body, which is somewhat neutral on its own\u2014just a physical change. However, the last part about hiding new secretions from parents adds an element of secrecy and perhaps embarrassment or discomfort.\n\nPutting this together, the text doesn't seem to express overtly positive emotions. Instead, it describes changes that might be awkward or concerning. The choice of words like \"strange hairs\" and \"secretions\" could imply some negativity, but not extremely so. There's no strong indication of happiness or positivity here.\n\nI should also consider if there's any sarcasm or irony, but the text seems straightforward. It's more about the physical transformations with a neutral to slightly negative tone because of the secrecy involved. Therefore, it doesn't lean towards positive at all.\n\nSo, considering the scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, this sentiment falls into the negative category. But how negative? The text isn't overly harsh; it's more about the awkwardness of changes rather than something extremely negative.

That part seems positive.\n\nBut then it says Howard had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted. Pretentiousness is generally considered negative because it implies being overly ambitious or showy in a way that's off-putting. So this part is pointing out a downside, making the sentiment a bit negative.\n\nNow, I need to weigh these two parts. The first part is positive, and the second is negative. How strong are each of them? \"Labour of love\" is quite positive, but then it's followed by something that's critical of Howard's approach. The use of \"pretentious\" suggests criticism, so perhaps this tilts the sentiment more towards negative.\n\nBut I also have to consider if there's any neutrality here. The sentence doesn't express an extreme emotion; it's more of a balanced view. It acknowledges the effort but also points out a flaw. So maybe it's not extremely positive or extremely negative.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the sentiment is slightly negative because of the criticism towards pretentiousness, even though there's a positive element about the labor of love. But it's not very strongly negative. Therefore, I would classify this as 1 (negative).\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if \"free rein\" is entirely negative. Sometimes having free rein can be a good thing because it shows trust or creativity. However, in this context, combined with \"pretentious,\" it seems more like a criticism.

The output has to be an integer from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive. \n\nFirst, let me read the text carefully: \"antwone fisher certainly does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories but , with few exceptions , it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it.\"\n\nHmm, breaking this down. The first part says that the movie (I assume Antwone Fisher is a movie) makes us care about the protagonist and celebrate his victories. That sounds positive because making people care and celebrating victories are good things.\n\nBut then there's a \"but\" which usually introduces a contrast or a negative point. It goes on to say that with few exceptions, it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions. So here, they're saying the movie doesn't rely much on manipulative or overly sentimental tactics, which is a positive because those are often seen as bad in storytelling.\n\nPutting it together: The text acknowledges the movie's ability to make us care about the protagonist and celebrate his wins without resorting to cheap tricks. This seems like a balanced but slightly positive review. \n\nSo, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The sentiment here isn't extremely positive because there's a slight criticism in the \"but,\" but it's still mostly positive. Therefore, I think it would be a 3 (positive) rather than a 4 since it's not overly enthusiastic.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a positive sentiment by highlighting the movie's ability to engage viewers without resorting to cheap tactics, though with a slight reservation noted. \n\nAnswer: 3", 3, 3, 37.49303389099077], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It compares Robinson's work to Clancy's, specifically mentioning \"web of suspense\" and \"page-turning frenzy.\" Both phrases sound positive because they imply excitement and engagement in the storytelling.\n\nI notice that words like \"suspense\" and \"frenzy\" are often associated with thrilling and captivating stories, which are desirable qualities. So, the sentiment here is positive since it's highlighting how effective Robinson's work is, equating it to Clancy's, who I assume is a well-regarded author.\n\nThere's no negative language used; instead, it's a compliment by comparison. Therefore, the sentiment isn't neutral or negative\u2014it\u2019s clearly on the positive side. The intensity seems moderate because while it's praising, it doesn't use superlatives like \"incredible\" or \"amazing.\" \n\nSo, considering 4 is very positive and 3 is positive, I think this falls into a solid positive category without being overly exaggerated. Hence, the sentiment score should be 3.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a positive sentiment by comparing Robinson's work favorably to Clancy's, highlighting suspense and engagement.\n\n3", 3, 4, 27.70773722199374], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The first part says \"expands the limits of what a film can be.\" That sounds positive because expanding limits usually implies innovation or pushing boundaries, which is a good thing in creative works like films.\n\nNext, it mentions \"taking us into the lives of women to whom we might not give a second look if we passed them on the street.\" This part seems to highlight that the film focuses on ordinary or perhaps overlooked individuals. That could be seen as positive because it suggests inclusivity and giving attention to people who are often ignored.\n\nPutting it together, both parts seem to have a positive connotation. The first part praises the film's innovative approach, while the second part lauds its focus on everyday women. There's no negative language here; instead, it's appreciative of what the film accomplishes.\n\nI don't see any words that indicate negativity or neutrality. Words like \"expands\" and \"taking us into\" are active and approving verbs. The overall tone is complimentary towards the film's approach and subject matter. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the sentiment is positive. It doesn't go overboard with superlatives, but it clearly has a favorable view. Therefore, it should be classified as 3 (positive).\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 3, 35.24781893499312], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts by mentioning \"films like Kangaroo Jack,\" which is followed by \"about to burst across America's winter movie screens.\" The word \"burst\" here might imply something sudden and maybe overwhelming, but it's not necessarily negative on its own.\n\nThen, the sentence says, \"it's a pleasure to have a film like The Hours as an alternative.\" The key words here are \"pleasure\" and \"alternative.\" \"Pleasure\" is clearly positive, indicating enjoyment or satisfaction. \"Alternative\" suggests that while there might be other options (like Kangaroo Jack), The Hours offers something different and preferable.\n\nPutting it together, the speaker seems to appreciate having a better film option available when others like Kangaroo Jack are about to dominate the screens. So they're contrasting a less appealing option with a more positive one, which tilts the sentiment towards positive.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 is very negative, so that's not it. 1 is negative, but there's a clear positive element here. Neutral (2) might be if the sentiment were mixed or unbiased, but the use of \"pleasure\" leans it more positive. Positive (3) fits because they express enjoyment and preference for The Hours. Very positive (4) would require even stronger language, which isn't present here.\n\nSo I think 3 is the right classification.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence contrasts the upcoming films with a favorable view of \"The Hours,\" using the word \"pleasure.\" This indicates a positive sentiment.\n\n3", 3, 3, 40.06917935499223], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, looking at the words used. The text starts with \"smart\" and \"funny,\" both positive adjectives. That's a good sign for a positive sentiment. Then it mentions being \"honest enough,\" which also seems positive because honesty is often valued. \n\nThe next part talks about providing \"pleasures,\" which is clearly a positive word. It then describes the play as \"slightly naughty\" and \"just-above-average.\" Hmm, \"slightly naughty\" could be neutral or even a bit negative depending on context, but in this case, it might just add to the entertainment value without being harmful.\n\nPutting it all together: The text is using positive descriptors like smart, funny, honest, and pleasures. It's talking about an off-Broadway play that's above average, which is a compliment. There are no negative words here; even \"slightly naughty\" doesn't seem to detract from the overall positivity.\n\nSo, considering all these elements, I think the sentiment is positive. The highest score would be 4 for very positive, but since it mentions \"just-above-average,\" maybe it's not extremely positive. But given the other strong positives, I'm leaning towards a 3, which is positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses positive adjectives like \"smart,\" \"funny,\" and \"honest\" while describing the play as providing pleasures and being just above average.

The text starts with \"impressive images,\" which sounds positive because \"impressive\" usually means something good or striking. These images are of crematorium chimney fires and dead bodies, which are pretty grim subjects, but the use of \"impressive\" suggests they might be well done or effective in conveying a message.\n\nBut then it says these images are \"undermined by the movie's presentation,\" which is negative. The word \"undermined\" means weakened, so something is making those impressive parts less impactful. Then it describes the movie's presentation as \"way too stagy.\" \"Stagy\" implies that the movie feels artificial or overly dramatic, like a stage play, which isn't usually seen as positive in a cinematic context.\n\nSo putting it together: The first part is positive about the images, but the second part criticizes the overall presentation. The negative aspect seems to outweigh the positive because the criticism is more direct and impactful. The movie's staging being too much might make viewers feel disconnected or that the film isn't effective in its storytelling.\n\nI should also consider how strong each sentiment is. \"Impressive\" is a strong positive, but \"undermined\" and \"way too stagy\" are pretty strong negatives. The overall feeling seems to be more negative because the presentation's flaw is seen as significant enough to reduce the effectiveness of the good images.\n\nSo I think the sentiment is on the negative side.

It's talking about a documentary called \"Home Movie.\" The focus isn't just on the unique houses but more on the people living there. These people have created a comfortable space for themselves in the world and are sharing that with others.\n\nThe words used here are positive. Words like \"unique,\" \"comfortable niche,\" and \"kind enough to share\" all carry positive connotations. The phrase suggests that the documentary highlights individuals who have found their place and are generous, which is a heartwarming message.\n\nI don't see any negative words or sentiments in this text.

The text seems quite complimentary towards the people featured in the documentary. Words like \"comfortable niche\" and \"kind enough to share\" are strong positive indicators. So maybe it should be a 4 for very positive. Hmm, that's possible because the sentiment is quite affirmative.\n\nBut I'm not sure if \"carved their own comfortable niche\" is super enthusiastic or just positive. It might lean more towards positive than extremely positive. Alternatively, considering how it's about sharing and being kind, which are strong positives, maybe 4 is appropriate.\n\nI think I'll go with 3 because while the sentiment is definitely positive, it doesn't use superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"fantastic.\" It's a balanced positive statement without extreme language.\n</think>\n\nThe text conveys a positive sentiment by highlighting the people in \"Home Movie,\" emphasizing their comfortable lifestyle and kindness.

George Lucas is mentioned as returning, which suggests he's coming back after some time away. The words \"visionary\" and \"tale full of nuance\" are strong positives. A visionary implies someone with innovative ideas, so that's a compliment. Nuance means depth or subtlety, indicating complexity in the story, which is often seen as positive.\n\nThen there's \"character dimension.\" This refers to well-developed characters, which is another positive aspect. So each part of the sentence seems to highlight positive qualities about George Lucas and his work.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. Everything points towards admiration or praise. The use of such positive adjectives suggests a very positive sentiment. \n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment is definitely on the positive side.

The word \"pedestrian\" here means ordinary or unimpressive, so it's a bit negative towards the title but contrasts with the actual quality of the documentary.

The word \"brilliant\" suggests something outstanding or excellent. So that's a strong positive indicator right there.\n\nNext part: \"since the 1984 uncut version of sergio leone 's flawed but staggering once upon a time in america.\" Here, they're comparing it to another work by Sergio Leone. They describe that previous work as \"flawed but staggering.\" The word \"flawed\" is negative, indicating some shortcomings, but \"staggering\" is very positive, meaning it's impressive or awe-inspiring.\n\nPutting this together, the person is saying that the current work they're talking about is the most brilliant since another movie which had both flaws and staggeringly good aspects. So overall, the sentiment towards both works seems to be quite positive.\n\nThe structure of the sentence emphasizes praise for the current work by referencing a highly regarded predecessor, despite acknowledging some flaws in that older film. This comparison likely elevates the current work's status.\n\nI don't see any negative words apart from \"flawed,\" which is balanced by \"staggering.\" The overall tone seems to lean heavily towards positive because of the use of strong adjectives like \"brilliant\" and \"staggering.\"\n\nSo, considering all this, the sentiment should be on the higher end.

The word \"arguably\" suggests that this might be a subjective opinion, but it doesn't make the sentiment negative. Then there's \"the best script,\" which is clearly a compliment. It says Besson has written in years, implying that his previous scripts weren't as good. So putting it all together, the statement is praising Besson's work.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 4 is very positive. Since this is a strong compliment, I think it should be on the higher end. \"Best\" indicates a high level of positivity. There's no ambiguity in the sentiment here; it's definitely positive.\n\nI don't see any negative words or phrases.

The phrase mentions \"twist endings,\" which are a common element in storytelling, often intended to surprise the audience. The word \"surprising\" here is key\u2014it's a positive adjective because it suggests that something unexpected and exciting happened.\n\nBut I also notice the question mark at the end. It makes me wonder if this is a statement or a question. If it's a question, maybe they're seeking examples of when twist endings were surprising, which could be neutral in sentiment. However, since the sentence structure is more like a declarative with a question mark, it might be expressing a positive sentiment because the user is pointing out that the twist was surprisingly good.\n\nThe word \"actually\" adds emphasis, suggesting that perhaps there's an expectation being met or exceeded. So maybe they're happy that the twist was effective and unexpected, which leans towards positivity.\n\nPutting this together, the sentiment seems positive but not extremely so. It\u2019s a compliment on how the twist endings were executed, making it more than neutral but not overwhelmingly positive.

The text provided is: \"the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to understand its components. The phrase starts with \"the emotional overload,\" which suggests that there's an excessive amount of emotion being portrayed. The word \"overload\" usually has a negative connotation because it implies something is overwhelming or too much.\n\nNext, it mentions \"female angst.\" Angst generally refers to feelings of anxiety, worry, or unease. While it can be a valid emotional expression, when combined with \"emotional overload,\" it might indicate that the portrayal is excessive or unmanageable, which could be seen as a negative aspect.\n\nThe phrase continues with \"irreparably drags the film down.\" The word \"irreparably\" means that something cannot be fixed or remedied. So, this suggests that the issue (the emotional overload and female angst) causes significant harm to the film, making it worse in an unrecoverable way.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence is expressing a negative view of the film. The use of strong negative words like \"overload,\" \"angst,\" and \"irreparably drags down\" all contribute to a critical perspective. The sentiment isn't just slightly negative but strongly so because of these choice words.\n\nI also notice that there's no positive language in this sentence. It doesn't mention anything redeeming about the film, only focusing on how certain elements negatively impact it. This reinforces the idea that the sentiment is very negative.\n\nSo considering all this, the sentiment isn't just a little negative; it's quite harsh. Therefore, I would classify this as 0 (very negative) because of the strong negative language used to describe the film's drawbacks.\n</think>\n\nThe text strongly criticizes the film with terms like \"emotional overload,\" \"female angst,\" and \"irreparably drags down,\" indicating a very negative sentiment.\n\nAnswer: 0", 0, 0, 46.33236742799636], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user has provided a specific sentence: \"as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west.\" I need to determine whether this expresses very negative (0), negative (1), neutral (2), positive (3), or very positive (4) sentiment.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. The phrase starts with \"as inept as,\" which immediately signals a negative connotation. \"Inept\" means lacking the necessary skills or effectiveness, so that's a red flag for negativity right there. \n\nNext, looking at what follows: \"big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west.\" The Avengers is a well-known superhero series, and Wild Wild West was a film adaptation from the 90s that wasn't particularly successful. Both of these examples are being compared to something (probably another big-screen remake) as being inept.\n\nSo putting it together, the sentence is saying that something is as bad or ineffective as those remakes. Since both The Avengers and Wild Wild West have had mixed receptions, especially in their remake forms, this comparison is likely meant to criticize the subject for being just as poorly done.\n\nI should also consider the structure of the sentence. It's a simile using \"as inept as,\" which often emphasizes a negative quality. There are no positive words here; everything points towards criticism or dissatisfaction.\n\nConsidering possible scores: 0 (very negative), 1 (negative). The use of \"inept\" is quite strong, so it leans more towards very negative. However, sometimes people might see \"inept\" as just negative without reaching the extreme of very negative. But given that it's a direct criticism comparing to well-known failed examples, I think it's safe to say this is at least a 1.\n\nI should also think about whether there's any nuance I'm missing. Is there sarcasm or irony here? The sentence doesn't seem sarcastic; it appears straightforward in its criticism. So, no hidden positivity here.\n\nIn conclusion, the sentiment expressed is negative because of the use of \"inept\" and the unfavorable comparison to other remakes.

The main subject here is \"waydowntown,\" which seems to be a place or maybe an area downtown. It's described as managing to \"nail\" something, which means it successfully captures or portrays that thing.\n\nThe next part is about \"spirit-crushing ennui.\" Ennui refers to a feeling of listlessness or boredom, and adding \"spirit-crushing\" intensifies that negative emotion. So this part is definitely negative\u2014it's talking about a draining sense of boredom in urban living.\n\nHowever, the sentence continues: \"without giving in to it.\" This phrase suggests that while waydowntown captures this ennui, it doesn't succumb or give into those feelings. It might mean that despite the challenges or negative aspects, there's some resistance or resilience shown.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment isn't entirely negative because even though it acknowledges a negative feeling (ennui), it also highlights that waydowntown manages to do this without giving in, which could imply a neutral or slightly positive take.

It seems like someone feels they're understanding something, but then an event occurs that makes them realize it doesn't make sense anymore. The phrase \"just when you think\" suggests a letdown or disappointment because their initial understanding was overturned.\n\nThe word \"something happens\" could imply an unexpected turn of events. The second part, \"tells you there is no sense,\" indicates confusion or frustration. This could mean the person feels defeated or stuck in a loop where they can't find meaning.\n\nI'm considering if this is negative. The feeling of making progress only to have it dashed could lead to disappointment. However, since it's not overly emotional with strong words like \"hate\" or \"terrible,\" maybe it's just negative rather than very negative.\n\nSo, putting it together, the sentiment seems negative because of the letdown and confusion expressed but not extremely so.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the text provided is: \"this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them !\"\n\nOkay, so I need to analyze the sentiment expressed here. The user mentioned it's a poster movie and a mediocre tribute. The words used are \"mediocre\" which usually means something is just average or not very good. So that suggests a negative sentiment.\n\nBut then they say \"tribute to films like them.\" Tribute can sometimes be positive, especially if it's paying homage to something else. However, the word \"mediocre\" before it seems to downplay any potential positivity. It's more about being average than anything praiseworthy.\n\nSo putting that together: \"poster movie\" might mean it's made just for marketing or isn't a real film, which is negative. Then \"mediocre tribute\" adds to that by saying even the tribute aspect isn't great. The exclamation mark at the end could indicate strong feeling, but since the words are negative, it emphasizes the negativity.\n\nI don't think there's any positive language here; it's all pointing towards something not very good. So I'm leaning towards a negative sentiment.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, and so on up to 4 being very positive. Since \"mediocre\" isn't extremely negative but still clearly negative, maybe it's a 1 instead of a 0 because 0 might be reserved for something more harshly negative.\n\nWait, but the user also used \"poster movie,\" which I think is a term that can have different connotations. Sometimes it's used neutrally, but in this context with \"mediocre,\" it probably means it's not a real film or just a shallow attempt, which would be negative.\n\nSo putting it all together: The sentiment expressed here seems to be negative because of the use of words like \"mediocre\" and \"poster movie.\" It doesn't seem extremely negative, so maybe 1 is the right classification instead of 0. But I'm not entirely sure if \"poster movie\" is a strong enough term on its own without more context.\n\nAlternatively, if \"poster movie\" is used in a way that's more critical than just neutral, then it could be 0. But I think since the main negative word is \"mediocre,\" which isn't extremely harsh, it's probably a 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to the use of words like \"mediocre\" and the implication that it's not a real film.

The main subject here is the script, which is being described in two parts: \"becomes lifeless\" and \"falls apart like a cheap lawn chair.\" Both of these phrases seem negative.\n\nThe word \"lifeless\" suggests that there's no energy or vitality, which isn't positive. It implies something lacks spirit or interest. Then, comparing it to a \"cheap lawn chair\" falling apart adds another layer of negativity. A cheap lawn chair is typically not durable and might be seen as low-quality or unsatisfactory. So, the metaphor here likens the script's failure to an item that isn't built well.\n\nPutting these together, both descriptors are negative. The sentiment expressed isn't just neutral; it's clearly pointing towards something being bad or of poor quality. Since 0 is very negative and 1 is negative, I need to decide which fits better. The use of metaphors like \"lifeless\" and comparing it to a falling-apart lawn chair makes the statement quite strong in its negativity.\n\nI think 0 would represent very negative, but sometimes people might rate things as 1 if they're somewhat negative but not extremely so. However, considering the vivid and harsh comparisons used here, it seems more aligned with a very negative sentiment rather than just a slightly negative one.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence uses strong negative metaphors to describe the script as lifeless and likening it to a cheap, falling-apart lawn chair, indicating a very negative sentiment.\n\n0", 0, 1, 36.97349759799545], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me start by reading the sentence carefully: \"The re-enactments, however fascinating they may be as history, are too crude to serve the work especially well.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components. The phrase starts with \"however fascinating they may be,\" which suggests that there's some positive aspect\u2014the re-enactments are seen as interesting or engaging in terms of history. That part is clearly positive.\n\nBut then the sentence takes a turn. It says the re-enactments are \"too crude to serve the work especially well.\" The word \"crude\" has negative connotations, indicating that while they're interesting, they aren't effective enough for their intended purpose. This implies dissatisfaction or criticism towards how the re-enactments function within the context of the work.\n\nSo, there's a mix here: some positivity from the initial part and negativity from the latter. However, the overall sentiment leans more negative because the main point is about them being too crude, which overshadows the initial positive comment.\n\nNow, considering the scale:\n0 - Very Negative\n1 - Negative\n2 - Neutral\n3 - Positive\n4 - Very Positive\n\nThe statement isn't extremely negative; it's not using harsh words beyond \"crude.\" It doesn't express extreme dissatisfaction or anger. Instead, it points out a flaw but in a somewhat measured way. Therefore, I would classify this as a 1\u2014negative.\n\nI don't think it's neutral because the criticism is more prominent than the compliment. The positive aspect is mentioned only to contrast with the negative evaluation.

The descriptors are important here.\n\nBreaking it down, words like \"eloquent,\" \"reflective,\" and \"beautifully acted\" sound positive. These terms suggest something well-crafted and emotionally engaging. But then there's mention of \"profoundly devastating events\" and the \"slow, painful healing process.\" That definitely carries a negative connotation because it refers to difficult times.\n\nSo I'm thinking this is a mix of positive and negative elements. The performance itself is praised, which leans towards positive sentiment. However, the subject matter is about sad events and a tough recovery period, which is negative. \n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, but while there's sadness mentioned, it's balanced by praise for how it's portrayed. So maybe it's not the most negative. On the other hand, 4 (very positive) might be too high since the content isn't all positive.\n\nNeutral could be an option because it's a mix, but I think the positive descriptors about the acting and eloquence tilt it more towards positive than neutral. However, the subject matter is heavy, so maybe not extremely positive either. \n\nPutting this together, it seems like a 3 (positive) makes sense. The focus on how well something is portrayed despite the sad content suggests an overall positive sentiment in terms of execution.\n</think>\n\nThe text contains both positive descriptors (\"eloquent,\" \"reflective,\" \"beautifully acted\") and negative elements (\"profoundly devastating events,\" \"slow, painful healing process\").

It starts by saying that \"Borstal Boy isn't especially realistic.\" That part seems slightly negative because it's pointing out a lack of realism. However, the word \"isn't\" is used with \"especially,\" which might soften the criticism a bit. So it's not entirely negative but more like a mild criticism.\n\nThen the sentence continues: \"it is an engaging nostalgia piece.\" The words \"engaging\" and \"nostalgia\" have positive connotations. \"Engaging\" suggests that it's interesting or captivating, while \"nostalgia\" brings up feelings of longing for the past, which can be positive if the memories are good.\n\nPutting these together, the first part is a slight negative point, but the second part is clearly positive and stronger. The overall sentiment seems to lean more towards positive because even though it's not realistic, it still manages to engage and evoke nostalgia positively.\n\nI don't think it's extremely positive (4) because there's that initial criticism about realism. But it's definitely better than neutral or negative. So I'd rate this as 3, which is positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text presents a balanced view with a slight positive tilt.

The text is: \"a sloppy , amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down each part of the sentence to understand the sentiments expressed.\n\nThe first word is \"sloppy,\" which generally has a negative connotation. It suggests something messy or poorly done. So that's a negative point.\n\nNext, we have \"amusing,\" which is positive. Amusing means entertaining or funny in a way that makes people laugh or smile. That's a positive sentiment.\n\nThen there's \"comedy,\" which is neutral on its own because it just describes the genre without any emotional charge. It depends on other words to give it context.\n\nMoving on, \"proceeds from\" is neutral as well; it's just describing how something continues or develops.\n\nThe last part is \"a stunningly unoriginal premise.\" Here, \"stunningly\" intensifies the adjective \"unoriginal,\" which is negative. Unoriginal means lacking originality, so that's a negative point.\n\nSo, putting it all together: we have two negative elements (\"sloppy\" and \"stunningly unoriginal\") and one positive element (\"amusing\"). The rest are neutral or descriptive without sentiment.\n\nNow, considering the overall balance of sentiments. There are two negatives and one positive. However, the negative words are quite strong. \"Sloppy\" is a direct criticism, and \"unoriginal\" with the intensifier \"stunningly\" makes it even more critical.\n\nBut then there's \"amusing,\" which suggests that despite the flaws, the comedy still managed to be entertaining. So the sentiment isn't entirely negative; there's a mix here.\n\nI need to decide where this lands on the scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). Since there are both negative and positive elements, it might lean more towards neutral or slightly negative.\n\nWait, \"sloppy\" and \"unoriginal\" are strong negatives, but \"amusing\" is a positive that could balance it out. Maybe the overall sentiment isn't extremely negative. It's critical but acknowledges some entertainment value.\n\nSo perhaps it's on the lower end of the scale but not the very bottom. If 0 is very negative, and 2 is neutral, this might be around 1 (negative) or maybe 2 if considering the positive aspect. But given that the negatives are stronger and more prominent, I think it leans towards 1.\n\nAlternatively, some might see the mix as neutral, but the emphasis on \"sloppy\" and \"unoriginal\" might make it slightly negative overall.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment is classified based on a balance of strong negative words (\"sloppy,\" \"stunningly unoriginal\") and a positive word (\"amusing\").

Problems usually indicate something isn't right or satisfactory. Then it mentions \"van wilder,\" which I think is a movie or TV show. The next part is crucial: \"does little that is actually funny.\" So they're saying Van Wilder doesn't do much that's funny. That's clearly pointing out a lack of humor, which is a criticism.\n\nThe word \"little\" emphasizes scarcity, so it's not just a minor issue but something significant. Adding \"actually\" seems to stress that even what was expected (to be funny) isn't happening. The phrase \"with the material\" suggests that the content itself wasn't humorous either.\n\nPutting it all together, this statement is pointing out that Van Wilder fails to deliver humor effectively. It's a critique of the movie or show's inability to be funny. Since the sentiment is negative but not extremely so\u2014it doesn\u2019t use strong language like \"terrible\" or \"awful\"\u2014I think it falls under moderately negative.\n\nSo, looking at the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The statement isn't overly harsh but definitely critical. Therefore, I\u2019d classify this as a 1, which stands for negative.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative because it critiques Van Wilder's inability to deliver humor effectively without using extremely harsh language.\n\n1", 1, 1, 36.816452953004045], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Adding \"pretty\" as an intensifier suggests it's not just a little funny but moderately so.\n\nNext, they mention that most of the humor comes from the pairing of Crystal and De Niro. They describe this teaming as \"incongruous,\" which means unexpected or unlikely together, but then add that it's \"chemically perfect.\" That phrase \"chemically perfect\" is a strong positive statement, implying that despite their differences, the duo works exceptionally well together.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment is clearly positive. The reviewer enjoyed the movie's humor and specifically praised the actors' chemistry. However, there's no superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"hilarious beyond belief,\" which might push it to a 4. Instead, \"pretty funny\" suggests a solid positive but not an extremely high score.\n\nSo considering the options: 0 is very negative (definitely not), 1 negative (nope), 2 neutral (unlikely since they express enjoyment), and 3 or 4 as positive.

It implies something that is morally corrupt or degraded. So, that's definitely negative.\n2. **Incoherent**: This means not making sense or being unclear. While it doesn't carry as much emotional weight as 'depraved,' it still suggests a lack of quality or thoughtfulness, which leans towards negative.\n3. **Instantly disposable**: This phrase indicates that something is so poor in quality that it's immediately thrown away or discarded.

The speaker is talking about their expectations for two professionals, Michael Apted as a director and Nicholas Kazan as a screenwriter.

This suggests that the speaker is familiar with their past work and had certain expectations based on that.\n\nThe key part here is \"expect more than this clich\u00e9 pileup.\" The word \"clich\u00e9\" generally refers to something that's overused or lacks originality, so describing the current project as a \"clich\u00e9 pileup\" implies that it's filled with unoriginal ideas.

However, I need to decide if it's just negative or very negative.\n\nThe phrase \"expect more\" shows that there were higher expectations which weren't met. This indicates some level of dissatisfaction beyond just a simple negative statement. The use of \"clich\u00e9 pileup\" is quite strong, suggesting that the project wasn't just slightly below par but significantly lacking in originality and quality.\n\nOn the other hand, the sentence doesn't use extremely harsh language like \"disaster\" or \"terrible,\" which might tip it towards very negative (0). It's more about unmet expectations and a lack of originality. So while it's definitely negative, it might not be as extreme as 0.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards 1 because it conveys disappointment but isn't the most severe negative expression possible.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to unmet expectations and criticism of clich\u00e9s. It doesn't use extremely harsh language, so it's classified as 1 (negative).\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 0, 48.38745104699046], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let's break down the text step by step.\n\nThe text says: \"... enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm, the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games.\"\n\nFirst, I notice the word \"enthusiastically\" which is a strong positive adjective. It suggests excitement and energy. Then it mentions \"percussion rhythm,\" which sounds lively and upbeat. \"Brass soul\" adds another layer of enthusiasm, as brass instruments often bring a bold and energetic feel.\n\nNext, there's \"fierce competition.\" While the word \"fierce\" can sometimes have a negative connotation, in this context, it's referring to competition that makes something fun. So it's more about the excitement and engagement rather than negativity.\n\nThe phrase \"helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games\" ties everything together positively. It's saying that these elements contribute to making an enjoyable part of the experience. The overall tone seems positive, celebrating the energy and spirit of the marching bands in the context of college football.\n\nPutting it all together, each component points towards a positive sentiment without any negative indicators. So I'm leaning towards a higher score on the positivity scale.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 3, 29.33461707198876], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The output should be an integer from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive.\n\nFirst, let me read the sentence carefully. It says that \"Reign of Fire just might go down as one of the all-time great apocalypse movies.\" So the main point here is about the movie being considered among the all-time greats in its genre. \n\nThe phrase \"just might\" suggests some uncertainty but leans towards a positive sentiment because it's saying there's a possibility that this movie will be remembered as great. The word \"great\" itself is clearly positive, so that's a strong indicator.\n\nI should also consider the context. Apocalypse movies are a specific genre, and calling something an all-time great in that category means it stands out. So the sentiment isn't just neutral; it's actually quite positive. The person is praising the movie by placing it among the best in its genre.\n\nIs there any negative word here? I don't think so. Words like \"great\" and the overall structure imply a favorable opinion. There's no criticism or disappointment mentioned, which would have made the sentiment more neutral or negative.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment is positive because they're highlighting that the movie could be remembered as one of the best in its category. The use of \"just might\" doesn't diminish the positivity; it just softens the statement a bit but still keeps it on the positive side.\n\nI think this would rate higher than neutral. So on the scale from 0 to 4, where 4 is very positive, I'd say it's at least a 3 or 4. But since it says \"just might,\" maybe not extremely positive. However, considering that being called an all-time great is quite high praise, perhaps it deserves a 4.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 3, 40.978947815980064], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It has two parts: \"formuliac\" and \"fun\". The word \"formuliac\" seems like a play on words, combining \"formula\" and maybe \"liar\" or something else. I'm not entirely sure what it's implying. Maybe it's suggesting that something is formulaic, meaning predictable or lacking originality? That could have a slightly negative connotation because being too formulaic might be seen as uncreative.\n\nThen there's the word \"fun\". Fun is clearly positive. It indicates enjoyment and pleasure. So here we have two opposing sentiments: one possibly negative (formuliac) and one positive (fun). The text connects them with \"but,\" which often contrasts two ideas. So maybe it's saying that while something might be formulaic, it's still fun.\n\nNow, considering the overall sentiment. If someone says something is formulaic but fun, they're acknowledging a potential downside but emphasizing the positive aspect. It's like balancing a minor negative with a stronger positive. The focus seems to be on the fun part because it comes after \"but,\" which often highlights the more important point.\n\nSo, putting this together: the sentiment isn't entirely negative because of the positive word \"fun.\" But it also isn't very positive because of the mention of being formulaic. It's somewhere in between. The text doesn't express a neutral stance; instead, it leans towards positive despite the initial critique. \n\nI think the sentiment here is more on the positive side but not extremely so. So, out of the options given (0 to 4), I would rate this as 3 for positive. It's not very negative or just negative; it's leaning toward a favorable view because of the emphasis on fun.\n</think>\n\nThe text presents both a potential downside (\"formuliac\") and a strong positive aspect (\"fun\").

The text is talking about Don Michael Paul using certain film techniques\u2014quick-cuts, large shadows, wide-angle shots from a distance. These are all technical aspects of filmmaking. \n\nThe phrase \"to hide the liberal use of a body double\" seems critical. Using a body double often implies that the main actor (in this case, Seagal) isn't doing their own stunts or scenes, which can be seen as a negative point in terms of authenticity or effort.\n\nSo, the sentiment here is pointing out that the director used these techniques to cover up the fact that they relied heavily on a body double. This could be interpreted negatively because it suggests some level of dishonesty or lack of quality in production.\n\nBut how strong is this negativity? The sentence isn't using very harsh words; it's more observational than anything else. It doesn't use strong negative adjectives like \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" Instead, it just states that the techniques were used to hide something. So, while there's a critical element, it's not extremely harsh.\n\nI think this would be a 1 on the scale because it's negative but not overly so. It points out a flaw without being too severe in its language.\n</think>\n\nThe text critiques the use of specific film techniques to conceal reliance on a body double, indicating a negative sentiment.

Then \"refreshingly uninhibited enthusiasm\" \u2013 both \"refreshingly\" and \"enthusiasm\" are positive adjectives. They describe how the people approach their music despite facing poverty and hardship. \n\nSo, even though there's mention of poverty and hardship, which could be negative aspects, the overall sentiment seems to focus on the positive attitude and energy the people bring. The film is being praised for highlighting this positive trait in tough circumstances.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment isn't just neutral because it's not just stating facts; it's expressing admiration or approval. It's definitely not negative since the emphasis is on the positive aspect of their enthusiasm despite challenges.\n\nI think this should be a 3, which stands for positive. It doesn't seem extremely positive enough to be a 4 because while it's clearly positive, it might not reach that very high level.\n</think>\n\nThe text highlights positive aspects like \"refreshingly uninhibited enthusiasm\" despite challenging circumstances, indicating an overall approval.\n\n3", 3, 3, 28.847769968007924], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me read the sentence carefully: \"would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges.\" \n\nSo, the main part is saying that something would be a \"total loss,\" which sounds very negative. But then it adds a caveat with \"if not for\" and mentions two supporting performances that save it. The phrase \"taking place at the movie's edges\" suggests these performances are on the periphery but still significant.\n\nI think the sentence is expressing a mixed sentiment. On one hand, it's critical by calling something a \"total loss,\" which is quite negative. However, the presence of two supporting performances that prevent this from happening softens the negativity. The overall tone isn't extremely positive because it doesn't praise the movie but acknowledges that without those performances, it would be bad.\n\nSo, considering the options, 0 is too negative because there's a mitigating factor. It can't be neutral (2) because the statement leans towards the negative side despite the caveat. It's not positive enough to be 3 or 4 either.

It starts with \"Sadly,\" which immediately sets a negative tone. Then it mentions that Garth hasn't progressed as nicely as Wayne. So comparing Garth's progress to Wayne's, it seems like Garth isn't doing as well.\n\nThe word \"sadly\" is a strong indicator of a negative sentiment. The phrase \"hasn't progressed as nicely\" suggests disappointment or dissatisfaction with Garth's development compared to Wayne's. There's no positive language here; everything points towards something not going as expected, which is disappointing.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. The sentiment expressed isn't extremely negative, but it's clearly on the negative side because of \"sadly\" and the comparison showing lack of progress.\n\nI don't think it's a 0 (very negative) because there aren't any strong words beyond \"sadly.\" It's more of a disappointment than something catastrophic.

Let me read through the text again: \"anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but can't afford the $20 million ticket to ride a Russian rocket should catch this IMAX offering.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentiment here. The sentence starts by talking about people who have fantasies about space travel but can't afford it because tickets are expensive\u2014$20 million is a lot! That part seems negative because it's highlighting a barrier or something that people can't access.\n\nBut then the second part says they should \"catch this IMAX offering.\" Catching an IMAX movie usually implies that it's worth seeing, so maybe there's a positive suggestion here. The person is advising others to watch it, which might mean it's a good experience despite the initial disappointment about the cost.\n\nSo I'm trying to balance these two parts. On one hand, the high cost is a negative point. On the other hand, recommending the IMAX movie suggests something positive. But the first part sets up a problem (can't afford space travel), and then the second part offers an alternative solution (watch the movie instead). \n\nI wonder if the overall sentiment leans more neutral because it's pointing out both the downside of high costs but also providing a positive alternative. It doesn't express strong negative or positive emotions; rather, it's informative with a slight suggestion towards positivity in offering another way to experience space travel.\n\nSo putting it together: the initial part is somewhat negative, but then it shifts by giving a recommendation. Since there's both an obstacle and a solution presented neutrally, I think the sentiment isn't too strongly negative or positive. Therefore, I'd classify this as 2, which is neutral.\n</think>\n\nThe text points out the high cost of space travel as a barrier but suggests watching an IMAX movie as a viable alternative, balancing negative and positive elements.

The user gave me a sentence: \"But it's worth the concentration.\" They also specified that my output should be an integer from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. The word \"but\" often signals a contrast or exception, so maybe there was something challenging mentioned before this, but the speaker is saying it's still worth it. \"Worth the concentration\" implies that while it requires focus or attention, the outcome is positive enough to make it worthwhile.\n\nI should consider the sentiment words here. \"Concentration\" isn't inherently positive or negative; it depends on context. However, being \"worth\" something usually indicates a positive evaluation. The phrase suggests effort was made and it paid off, so the overall feeling is positive.\n\nNow, thinking about the scale: 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit because there's no indication of negativity. 1 is negative but again, the sentence seems more positive. Neutral (2) might be possible if there were mixed feelings, but \"worth\" leans positive. Positive (3) or very positive (4)? Since it's a straightforward approval without superlatives, I'd say it's moderately positive.

So, that's positive. It suggests that the cinematography is good, maybe artistic and vibrant.\n\nNext part: \"overacted.\" Overacting typically refers to an actor going too far in their performance, which can be seen as negative because it might make a scene feel exaggerated or unnatural.\n\nThen there's \"boozy self-indulgence.\" Boozy implies drinking, so perhaps the actors are indulging in alcohol. Self-indulgence here could mean they're not focused on their craft but rather on enjoying themselves excessively. That seems like a negative trait because it shows a lack of discipline or professionalism.\n\nLastly, \"...that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors.\" This part is definitely negative. It's saying that this self-indulgence makes even good actors perform poorly. The word \"worst\" clearly conveys negativity here.\n\nPutting it all together: The text has both positive and negative elements. The first part about being shot like a postcard is positive, but the rest of the sentence criticizes overacting and self-indulgence, which are negative points that seem to dominate the sentiment.\n\nThe positive aspect is brief compared to the lengthier criticisms. The negative parts highlight flaws in acting and behavior, which are significant issues in a performance review. So, overall, the sentiment leans more towards negative than positive.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 for very negative, 1 for negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. Since there's both positive and negative but the negatives are stronger, it might not be a 0 (very negative) because the first part is positive. But since most of the text focuses on the negatives, I think it should be either 1 or maybe 0. \n\nHowever, the positives aren't strong enough to counterbalance the negatives, so perhaps 1 for negative makes sense here. It's not extremely negative (which would be 0), but there are definitely more negative elements than positive.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment of the text is primarily negative due to the criticism of overacting and self-indulgence, despite a brief positive note on cinematography.\n\nOutput: 1", 1, 0, 52.8237871209858], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Constant smiles mean people were consistently happy, and frequent laughter shows they found things amusing or funny.\n\nPutting it together, both parts of the sentence highlight positive emotions.

The text doesn't use superlatives like \"extremely\" or \"incredibly,\" but the imagery of a sea of smiles and frequent laughter is quite strong. It conveys a very happy atmosphere, which would be very positive. So I think it should be a 4.\n\nI don't see any reasons to doubt this interpretation.

It talks about \"wiser souls,\" which suggests that these individuals possess some level of wisdom or maturity. They are described as having the tact to pretend not to see something and then leaving it lying there.\n\nThe phrase \"pretended not to see it\" implies a deliberate act of ignoring or avoiding a situation. This could be interpreted in different ways\u2014maybe they're avoiding conflict, which might be seen as positive because it shows restraint. On the other hand, pretending not to see something can also carry a negative connotation if it suggests avoidance of responsibility or important issues.\n\nThe phrase \"left it lying there\" adds another layer. If they left something lying, depending on what that something is, it could indicate neglect. But in context, since it's about wiser souls, perhaps it's more about letting go or not engaging with trivial matters, which might be a positive trait of not getting bogged down.\n\nSo putting it together: The text seems to commend those who avoid unnecessary confrontations by pretending not to notice something and then ignoring it. This could be viewed as a mature approach to dealing with situations that might otherwise cause conflict.\n\nIs there any negative connotation here? Well, if the \"something\" they're avoiding is important, then leaving it lying could be bad. But without context, we assume it's minor or something better left untouched. So overall, the sentiment leans positive because it's about handling situations wisely and avoidably.\n\nI don't see strong indicators of negativity; instead, it's more about a prudent approach. Therefore, I think the sentiment is neutral to slightly positive. Given the options, 2 (neutral) might be safe, but considering the commendation of wise behavior, maybe it's slightly positive, so I'll go with 3.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 2, 43.334142805979354], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user gave me a sentence: \"routine and rather silly.\" They want me to classify the sentiment on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive. \n\nFirst, I'll break down the words used. The word \"routine\" generally means something that's regular or unexciting. It can sometimes have a neutral connotation, but in this context, paired with another word, it might lean more negative. Then there's \"rather silly.\" Silly is definitely a negative term because it implies something is nonsensical or without much value. The use of \"rather\" before \"silly\" could make the sentiment stronger.\n\nPutting these together, the sentence seems to express that whatever they're talking about isn't just slightly silly but rather quite so, and it's also routine, which might mean repetitive in a boring way. So combining both words, the overall sentiment is negative. \n\nI don't see any positive words here. Both descriptors are pointing towards something not very good or exciting. Since \"silly\" is more on the stronger negative side, but \"routine\" isn't extremely bad, maybe it's just a regular negative rather than very negative. Therefore, I think this falls under 1, which is negative.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment of the text is classified as 1 (negative). \n\n1", 1, 2, 27.52606949399342], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user wants me to classify the sentiment of a given text as either 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), or 4 (very positive). The text provided is: \"it is that rare combination of bad writing, bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each sentiment score represents. 0 is very negative, which would be reserved for extremely harsh or strongly negative statements. A 1 is negative but maybe not as intense. Neutral is a 2, positive is 3, and very positive is 4.\n\nLooking at the text, it's clearly expressing dissatisfaction. The phrase \"rare combination\" suggests that all three elements\u2014writing, direction, and acting\u2014are bad together, which is rare, implying it's particularly noteworthy in a negative way. Using \"trifecta of badness\" is a strong statement, emphasizing that everything about the subject is poor.\n\nI should consider if this qualifies as very negative (0) or just negative (1). The use of \"bad\" three times and the term \"trifecta of badness\" seems quite harsh. It's not just one aspect being bad; it's all three, making it a complete failure in their eyes.\n\nSo, I think this is more than just negative\u2014it's very negative because it combines multiple negatives and uses strong language to emphasize the point.\n</think>\n\n0", 0, 0, 29.394103161001112], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The first part mentions \"offers an aids subtext.\" I'm not sure if that's positive or negative, but it doesn't seem too strong either way.\n\nNext is \"skims over the realities of gay sex.\" Skimming suggests that ozpetek isn't delving deeply into this topic, maybe even avoiding it. That could be seen as critical because it implies the content isn't thorough or honest about the subject matter.\n\nThen there's \"presents yet another tired old vision.\" The words \"yet another\" and \"tired old\" definitely have a negative connotation. It seems like ozpetek is rehashing something that's been done before, which isn't impressive and might be frustrating to someone looking for fresh perspectives.\n\nThe last part describes the gay community as an \"all-inclusive world where uptight, middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves.\" The use of \"uptight\" and \"bores\" are negative terms. It's suggesting that only people who fit a certain (perhaps unappealing) mold are being portrayed positively, which could be seen as limiting or stereotypical.\n\nPutting it all together: The text seems critical of ozpetek's approach. It's pointing out that the content is superficial, repetitive, and possibly misleading about the gay community. There are no positive elements mentioned here. So the sentiment is negative.\n\nHow strong is this negativity? It uses terms like \"tired old vision,\" which suggests frustration or disappointment. It doesn't just mildly criticize; it's a bit harsher. However, there aren't extreme words like \"horrific\" or \"disastrous.\" So I think it's more than just negative but not extremely so.\n\nI would rate this as a 1 on the scale\u2014negative. It\u2019s definitely not neutral because of the critical language used.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to the use of terms like \"skims over,\" \"tired old vision,\" and \"uptight bores.\" These phrases indicate dissatisfaction and criticism towards ozpetek's approach.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 0, 52.66905785098788], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts with \"best of all is garcia,\" which seems like a compliment. Using \"best\" suggests that Garcia stands out positively among others mentioned or implied. The word \"perfectly\" adds to this positivity because it implies that Garcia's portrayal was spot-on, which is a strong endorsement.\n\nHowever, the next part says, \"portrays the desperation of a very insecure man.\" Now, \"desperation\" and \"insecure\" are negative words. They describe a character in a bad light. But I have to consider the context here. The sentence isn't talking about Garcia himself but rather his portrayal of a character who is desperate and insecure.\n\nSo, the sentiment here is about how well Garcia acted. Since he perfectly portrayed a negative trait (desperation and insecurity), that doesn't necessarily make the sentiment negative towards Garcia. Instead, it's positive because it's praising his acting skills, even if the role itself was challenging or portrayed someone in a bad light.\n\nI need to weigh these elements. The beginning is clearly positive with \"best\" and \"perfectly.\" The latter part describes the character negatively but not Garcia. Therefore, the overall sentiment expressed towards Garcia is positive because it's about his performance being excellent, even though the role was of an insecure and desperate man.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment here is positive. Now, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The use of \"best\" and \"perfectly\" indicates a strong positive sentiment, but since the character's traits are negative, it might not be extremely positive. Maybe a 3 for positive.\n\nWait, but could it be higher? \"Best of all\" is quite a strong compliment, so perhaps it leans towards very positive. But then again, because the character portrayed is negative, does that affect the overall sentiment? I think it doesn't because the praise is directed at Garcia's performance, not the character's traits.\n\nSo maybe 4 for very positive.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is very positive due to the strong praise of Garcia's performance. \n\n4", 4, 4, 51.797711010993225], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It can have a negative connotation because it suggests that something is overdone or excessive in its emotionality.\n\nNext, \"melodramatic\" refers to something that's overly dramatic, often in a way that's seen as excessive or exaggerated. Again, this usually has a negative implication because it implies that the drama isn't genuine or is too intense.\n\n\"Bodice-ripper\" is a term typically used for romantic novels, especially those with strong, emotional content. While it can be neutral on its own, when paired with words like \"overwrought\" and \"melodramatic,\" it takes on a more negative tone because it's being criticized for being too dramatic or excessive.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment seems to be pointing towards something that's overly emotional and perhaps even to the point of being tiresome. The use of these adjectives suggests that the speaker doesn't approve of how exaggerated or over-the-top the subject is. Therefore, I would classify this sentiment as negative but not extremely so. It's more on the lower end rather than very positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses negative terms like \"overwrought\" and \"melodramatic,\" which criticize the subject for being overly emotional and excessive. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 31.223376075009583], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Then there's \"Charlotte's web of desire and desperation.\" Charlotte is likely referencing the character from \"The Catcher in the Rye,\" who has complex emotions, often negative.\n\nPutting it together, the phrases convey strong emotions leaning towards negative but not extremely so. There's a sense of yearning and despair mentioned, which are both negative feelings. However, it's not overly harsh or extreme; more like a moderate level of negativity.\n\nSo considering the scale, 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive.

The words here are \"a lot smarter\" which suggests that whatever is being compared (in this case, a bond) exceeds expectations in terms of intelligence or quality. The word \"smarter\" is a positive adjective, indicating something better than average. The phrase \"than your average bond\" implies that this particular bond stands out positively.\n\nI need to consider the context here. If someone says a bond is smarter than the average, they're likely praising it. Maybe it's performing better financially or has some innovative features. Either way, the sentiment seems positive because of words like \"a lot smarter,\" which are strong in their positivity.\n\nIs there any ambiguity? The word \"bond\" could refer to different things\u2014like a government bond or even James Bond. However, in this context, I think it's more about something that is considered average but this one is better, so the sentiment is still positive.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. There's no criticism or dissatisfaction expressed. It's all about being above average in a good way. So the sentiment isn't neutral; it's definitely leaning towards positive.\n\nHow strong is this positivity? The phrase uses \"a lot,\" which adds emphasis, making the sentiment quite strong. So instead of just a slight positive (maybe a 3), it's stronger than that. Therefore, I think it's a very positive sentiment, which would be 4.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a very positive sentiment because it highlights the bond as being significantly better than average.\n\n4", 4, 3, 37.82402939599706], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break it down.\n\nThe sentence is: \"the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating.\"\n\nFirst, I notice words like \"excellent\" and \"critiquing.\" \"Excellent\" is a strong positive word. So that's a plus.\n\nBut then it says the movie critiques itself at every \"faltering half-step.\" That phrase sounds negative because \"faltering\" suggests stumbling or weakness. So that part isn't so good.\n\nThen, it mentions that criticizing feels like commiserating. Commiserating means feeling sorry for someone else's misfortune. So even though they're critiquing the movie, it's more about feeling bad for it rather than harsh criticism.\n\nPutting it all together: The movie is self-critical, and while the text points out its flaws (which are negative), the way it's presented is almost sympathetic. It's like saying the movie does a good job of pointing out its own issues, which makes the critique feel more understanding than harshly negative.\n\nSo overall sentiment isn't super positive because there are criticisms, but it's not overly negative either. The use of \"excellent\" adds a positive spin to how the movie handles its self-critique. So maybe it's slightly positive but not very intense. \n\nI think 3 (positive) might be a good fit here because while there are negatives mentioned, the overall tone is appreciative of how the movie handles its flaws, which leans more towards a positive sentiment.\n</think>\n\nThe text acknowledges the movie's self-critique in a sympathetic light, using \"excellent\" to highlight its ability.

Words like \"chilling,\" \"unnerving\" describe the film. These terms are generally negative; they create a sense of discomfort or fear.\n\nThen, describing the women's lives: \"claustrophic,\" \"suffocating,\" and \"chilly.\" These words evoke feelings of oppression, discomfort, and coldness. \"Claustrophobic\" suggests confinement, which is unpleasant. \"Suffocating\" implies difficulty in breathing, indicating distress. \"Chilly\" can mean both physically cold or emotionally distant, but in this context, it likely adds to the overall negative atmosphere.\n\nThe sentence also mentions that their lives were as such as the attics they were consigned to. Attics are often depicted as isolated, maybe even creepy places, adding to the negative imagery.\n\nPutting it all together, the adjectives used are predominantly negative, painting a grim picture of the women's lives and the film's atmosphere. There's no positive language here; everything points towards discomfort, oppression, and negativity.\n\nSo, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The text doesn't express extreme negativity (like intense anger or despair), but it's definitely on the negative side with words that create a chilling and suffocating environment.\n\nI think this would be classified as a 1 because while there's a strong negative sentiment, it's not extremely so; it's more about the unsettling nature rather than outright despair.\n</think>\n\nThe text describes the film and the women's lives using predominantly negative adjectives like \"chilling,\" \"unnerving,\" \"claustrophic,\" \"suffocating,\" and \"chilly.\" These words evoke a sense of discomfort, oppression, and coldness.

The user wants me to classify it as either 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), or 4 (very positive). Let's break down the text.\n\nThe sentence is: \"then you get another phone call warning you that if the video isn't back at blockbuster before midnight, you're going to face frightening late fees.\"\n\nHmm. First, I notice that there are some negative words here. The word \"warning\" suggests something bad is about to happen. Then, \"frightening late fees\" \u2013 both \"frightening\" and \"late fees\" have negative connotations. Frightening implies fear or anxiety, which is definitely a negative emotion.\n\nSo the person receiving this phone call is being told they'll face high late fees if they don't return the video by midnight. That sounds stressful and frustrating. They might feel worried about the extra costs or maybe annoyed at having to deal with this situation again (\"another phone call\" suggests it's not the first time).\n\nBut I also need to consider the context. The sentiment isn't extremely positive, obviously. It's definitely negative because of the threat of late fees. But is it very negative (0) or just negative (1)? \n\nLooking at other examples I've seen, if someone is being threatened with legal action or something dire, that might be a 0. In this case, it's about late fees, which are annoying but not life-threatening. So maybe it's more of a 1 than a 0.\n\nWait, but the use of \"frightening\" might push it towards being very negative because it conveys strong anxiety or fear. However, considering that the consequence is financial rather than something like personal harm, perhaps it's still on the lower end of negativity. So maybe 1.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about how people usually feel when getting a late fee warning, they might be a bit stressed but not extremely so. It's more of a mild negative sentiment rather than very negative. Therefore, 1 makes sense here.\n</think>\n\nThe text conveys a negative sentiment due to the threat of high late fees causing anxiety.

The options are 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), 4 (very positive).\n\nFirst, let me break down the sentence. It talks about a film's images giving a backbone to a company and providing an emotional edge to its ultimate demise.\n\nHmm, \"backbone\" usually means something strong or essential. So maybe the images are important for the company. But then it says they provide an emotional edge to the company's ultimate demise. Demise is a negative word\u2014it means death or failure. So even though the backbone part sounds positive, the overall sentiment might be negative because of the demise.\n\nBut I'm not sure if \"provide an emotional edge\" is good or bad. An emotional edge could mean it makes people feel strongly about the company's end, which might make the story more impactful but doesn't necessarily make the sentiment itself negative unless the context implies that. Since the company is facing a demise, which is a failure or end, I think the overall feeling here is negative.\n\nBut wait, maybe the images are strong and give depth to the company's downfall, making it more compelling rather than just being negative. So perhaps it's not as straightforward. The use of \"backbone\" suggests that the images are crucial in supporting the narrative, which could be seen as positive for the film but leads to a negative outcome for the company.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating it. The key words here are \"ultimate demise,\" which is definitely a negative term. Even though the images provide backbone and emotional edge, the focus is on the downfall of the company. So the sentiment expressed is likely negative.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 3, 38.02282909597852], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The input provided is just \"the script?\" Hmm, that's pretty short. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should consider what sentiment analysis entails. It involves determining the emotional tone behind words. Positive sentiments might include happiness, excitement, satisfaction, while negative could involve sadness, anger, or frustration. Neutral would be when there's no strong emotion either way.\n\nLooking at \"the script?\", it seems like a question. Maybe someone is asking about a script, but without any additional context, it's hard to gauge the sentiment. The word \"script\" itself is neutral; it could refer to anything from a movie script to a programming script or even a play. Without knowing more about what the script entails, I can't determine if there's any positive or negative connotation.\n\nIs there any implied emotion in the phrase? It ends with a question mark, which might indicate curiosity, confusion, or uncertainty. But that doesn't necessarily make it positive or negative. The speaker could be seeking information without expressing any particular sentiment.\n\nI also need to think about the structure of the sentence. It's just two words and a question mark. There are no adjectives or strong verbs that would give away sentiment. If there were something like \"The script is amazing,\" that would clearly be positive. Conversely, \"The script is terrible\" would be negative. But as it stands, \"the script?\" doesn't provide any clues.\n\nAnother angle is to consider if the context around this phrase could influence the sentiment. For example, if someone was frustrated and asked about the script, maybe because they had trouble with it, that might lean towards negative. Alternatively, if they were excited to discuss a new script, it could be positive. But without any surrounding text or context, I can't make those assumptions.\n\nI should also think about how people use language in different contexts. Sometimes, a question like this might be part of a larger conversation where sentiment is already established. For instance, if the previous statements were negative, then asking \"the script?\" might continue that tone. But again, without knowing the full context, it's speculative.\n\nGiven all these points, I think the safest classification here is neutral because there's no explicit positive or negative language used. The phrase doesn't express any emotion on its own and could be interpreted in various ways depending on the situation. So, assigning a 2 seems appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed by \"the script?\" is neutral as it lacks any emotional indicators.\n\nAnswer: 2", 2, 1, 56.812604720995296], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user has provided a sentence: \"Their computer-animated faces are very expressive.\" My task is to determine if this sentiment is very negative (0), negative (1), neutral (2), positive (3), or very positive (4).\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. The subject here is \"computer-animated faces,\" and the adjective used is \"very expressive.\" The word \"expressive\" generally has a positive connotation because it suggests that something is able to convey emotions effectively. Adding \"very\" as an intensifier makes it more emphatic.\n\nI should consider what \"expressive\" means in this context. In animation, having expressive faces often means the characters can show a wide range of emotions clearly. This is typically seen as a positive trait because it enhances storytelling and character development, making the animation more engaging for viewers.\n\nThere's no negative language here. The sentence doesn't criticize or complain about anything; instead, it praises the quality of the animated faces. So, there's no element that would make this neutral or negative. It's clearly a compliment.\n\nNow, thinking about the scale: 0 is very negative, which doesn't apply here. Negative (1) also isn't suitable because the sentiment isn't negative. Neutral (2) might be if it were just stating a fact without any positive or negative spin, but \"very expressive\" adds a positive element. Positive (3) seems appropriate since it's a compliment. Very positive (4) would imply an even stronger sentiment, maybe with words like \"incredible\" or \"amazing.\" Here, while it's positive, it's not overly so.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the sentence is expressing satisfaction and approval about the expressive quality of the animated faces. It's a positive statement but doesn't go beyond that to be extremely enthusiastic.

It starts with \"one of the year's best films,\" which immediately sounds like high praise. Using the word \"best\" indicates that it's among the top, so that's a strong positive statement.\n\nThen, it mentions \"featuring an Oscar-worthy performance by Julianne Moore.\" The term \"Oscar-worthy\" is also very positive because it suggests that her acting was of such quality that it deserved recognition at the Oscars. This is a significant compliment, especially in the context of films and performances.\n\nPutting these two parts together, both components are highly positive. There's no negative language used here; instead, everything points towards commendation and admiration for both the film and the actress's performance.\n\nI should also consider if there's any sarcasm or irony, but nothing in the text suggests that. It seems genuine praise without any hidden negatives.\n\nSo, considering the scale:\n- 0: Very Negative\n- 1: Negative\n- 2: Neutral\n- 3: Positive\n- 4: Very Positive\n\nSince both parts of the sentence are extremely positive and use strong adjectives like \"best\" and \"Oscar-worthy,\" it leans towards being very positive.

The scale is from 0 being very negative to 4 being very positive. \n\nThe text in question is: \"a genuinely moving and wisely unsentimental drama.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down each word to understand the sentiment.\n\n- \"Genuinely\" adds a layer of sincerity. It's a positive modifier because it emphasizes that something is true or real.\n- \"Moving\" generally has a positive connotation here, as in emotionally impactful without being overly sentimental.\n- \"Wisely\" suggests intelligence or good judgment, which is another positive adjective.\n- \"Unsentimental\" might seem neutral at first glance. It means not overly emotional, but in this context, it's used positively to describe the drama as balanced and thoughtful rather than over-the-top emotional.\n- \"Drama\" is a genre descriptor without inherent sentiment, so it doesn't add positivity or negativity on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: The text is praising the drama by calling it genuinely moving and wisely unsentimental. Both descriptors are positive. It's not just a simple compliment but one that emphasizes depth and balance in the storytelling. \n\nSo, considering the scale, 0 is very negative, which doesn't apply here. 1 is negative, also not the case. Neutral (2) might be too low because there's clear praise. Positive (3) seems accurate as it captures the favorable sentiment without being overly enthusiastic. Very positive (4) would imply an even higher level of enthusiasm or superlatives, which I don't see here.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment is positive, so the classification should be 3.\n</think>\n\nThe text praises the drama with positive adjectives like \"genuinely moving\" and \"wisely unsentimental,\" indicating a favorable yet balanced view. \n\nAnswer: 3", 3, 4, 38.75712951098103], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text provided is \"heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the words used. The term \"heartwarming\" is definitely a positive adjective; it suggests something warm, touching, or emotionally uplifting. Then there's \"gently comic,\" which also has a positive connotation because humor is generally considered a positive emotion. \n\nHowever, the sentence continues with \"even as the film breaks your heart.\" That phrase introduces a more negative element. To break someone's heart usually means causing sadness or emotional pain, so that part is clearly negative.\n\nNow, I need to weigh these elements against each other. The first two parts are positive descriptors, but they're followed by a statement that brings in a significant negative aspect. So the sentiment isn't entirely positive because of the sad element, nor is it entirely negative since there's still warmth and humor mentioned.\n\nConsidering the scale from 0 to 4, where 2 is neutral, I have to decide if this overall leans more towards positive or negative. The first part sets a positive tone with heartwarming and gently comic elements, but the latter part adds emotional depth by causing sadness. It seems like the text is trying to balance both feelings\u2014happiness from the story and sadness at the same time.\n\nI think the presence of two positive adjectives might make it lean towards positive rather than negative or neutral. The phrase \"even as\" suggests that despite the heartbreak, there's still something positive about the film. So maybe the sentiment is more on the positive side but not extremely so because of the emotional conflict.\n\nLooking at the scale again: 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit here. 1 is negative; also doesn't seem right because there are positive elements. 2 is neutral\u2014could be possible if the positives and negatives balance out exactly. But since the text starts with positive words and then introduces a sad aspect, perhaps it's slightly more towards positive but not extremely.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider how strong each sentiment is. \"Heartwarming\" and \"gently comic\" are both strong positive terms. The sadness comes in as the film breaks your heart, which is significant, but the way it's phrased\u2014\"even as\"\u2014implies that despite this, there's still a positive experience from the heartwarming and comic parts.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the sentiment leans towards positive. It's not extremely positive because of the emotional conflict, so maybe a 3\u2014positive. Alternatively, if the sadness is quite impactful, perhaps it could be considered neutral at 2. But given that the first part sets a positive tone and the second part adds depth without overpowering the positives, I think 3 is more appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is primarily positive due to the heartwarming and gently comic elements, despite the emotional conflict introduced by the film breaking your heart.\n\nAnswer: 3", 3, 3, 67.04678670698195], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The word \"flawed\" has a negative connotation, suggesting that there are shortcomings or issues with whatever is being discussed\u2014probably a movie or performance since it mentions seeing something for someone's performance. However, the phrase \"but worth seeing\" introduces a contrasting positive aspect. Despite its flaws, the speaker thinks it's still valuable to watch because of Ambrose's performance.\n\nSo, the sentiment isn't entirely negative because the latter part is encouraging and positive. It's not overly positive either since there are acknowledged flaws. The overall tone seems balanced but leans slightly towards positive because the recommendation is made despite the negatives.\n\nLooking at the scale: 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit here because of the positive encouragement. 1 is negative, but again, the text isn't just negative; it's more mixed. Neutral would be 2, but since there's a slight positivity in recommending it, maybe it's a bit higher than neutral. However, it's not extremely positive either, so 3 (positive) might be appropriate. But considering that the first part is negative and the second is positive, I'm leaning towards a slightly above neutral score.\n\nWait, another angle: \"flawed\" is definitely negative, but then it's balanced by saying it's worth seeing for Ambrose's performance. So, perhaps the sentiment isn't overly positive but has a cautiously positive note. Maybe a 2 (neutral) or 3 (positive). Since there's an encouragement to watch despite flaws, I think it leans more towards positive than neutral.\n\nBut wait, if someone says \"flawed\" and then says \"worth seeing,\" they're balancing negative with positive. The emphasis is on the recommendation, so maybe it's a 3. Alternatively, some might see it as more balanced but not strongly positive. However, I think the key here is that despite flaws, it's worth watching, which indicates an overall positive sentiment.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Negative word \"flawed,\" but then positive encouragement to watch because of Ambrose. The balance tips towards positive, so 3 seems appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a cautious positivity by acknowledging flaws but recommending the experience due to Ambrose's performance. \n\nOutput: 3", 3, 2, 52.7964873489982], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It's supposed to be classified on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). \n\nLet me start by breaking down the sentence. The structure begins with \"But,\" which often introduces a contrast. However, in this context, it seems more like an introductory word rather than indicating a negative point because what follows is positive about the performances. \n\nThe key part here is the praise for Pacino, Williams, and Swank's performances. The phrase \"keep the viewer wide-awake\" suggests that their acting was engaging and held the audience's attention throughout. This implies that the performances were strong enough to maintain interest, which is a positive sentiment.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. Words like \"performances,\" \"viewer,\" and \"wide-awake\" all contribute positively. There's no criticism mentioned; instead, it's highlighting something praiseworthy about the actors' work.\n\nSince the statement is entirely positive without any hints of negativity or neutrality, I think this falls under a very positive sentiment. The word \"keep\" shows an ongoing action that has a positive effect, reinforcing the positive aspect.\n\nSo considering all that, I would classify this as 4, which stands for very positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text praises the actors' performances for keeping viewers engaged and awake, indicating a strong positive sentiment.\n\n4", 4, 4, 31.054530438006623], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence is: \"Hopkins doesn't so much phone in his performance as fax it.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. The phrase \"phone in\" usually refers to giving a lackluster effort, like not putting in much work. So saying someone \"phones in their performance\" implies they didn't do a great job. But then the sentence goes further and says \"fax it,\" which is even more dismissive. Faxing something might imply that the effort was so minimal or impersonal that it's almost just sending a document without any care.\n\nSo putting it together, this seems like a negative comment about Hopkins' performance. It's not just saying he wasn't great; it's comparing his effort to something even less personal and more lackluster than phoning in. That makes the sentiment quite negative.\n\nNow, I have to map this sentiment to the scale provided: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. Since the comment is quite harsh, using \"fax it\" as a more extreme version of phoning in, I think it's more than just negative\u2014it's very negative.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment here should be classified as 0.\n</think>\n\nThe statement criticizes Hopkins' performance by comparing it to faxing, which is even less personal and effortful than phoning in.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, the sentence mentions Nicholson's performance. The adjective used is \"understated,\" which generally means something is done without showiness or excess. In acting terms, an understated performance often refers to a more subtle and perhaps realistic portrayal of a character. It doesn't mean the acting was bad; instead, it's a specific style that can be highly praised.\n\nNext, the word \"wonderful\" stands out as a strong positive adjective. This clearly indicates that the speaker or writer has a favorable opinion of Nicholson's performance. The combination of \"understated\" and \"wonderful\" suggests that while the acting wasn't flashy, it was still impressive and effective in its subtlety.\n\nSo putting it together, the sentiment expressed is definitely positive because of the use of \"wonderful.\" But how strong is this positivity? On a scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, I need to determine if it's just a mild positive or something stronger.\n\nThe word \"wonderful\" is quite positive. It conveys that Nicholson's performance was not just good but exceptional in its subtlety. Therefore, the sentiment isn't neutral (which would be 2) because there's a clear positive adjective. It's also more than just a simple positive; it's effusive enough to rate higher.\n\nConsidering the scale, 3 represents a positive sentiment and 4 is very positive. Since \"wonderful\" is a strong word but not overly superlative beyond that, I think 3 is appropriate here. The reviewer clearly appreciates Nicholson's performance, using a positive adjective without any hyperbole.\n\nI don't see any negative words or implications in the sentence, so there's no reason to rate it below neutral. Therefore, the sentiment is positive, but not extremely so; hence, a score of 3 makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses \"wonderful\" to describe Nicholson's performance, indicating a positive sentiment. The word conveys strong approval, making the sentiment very positive.\n\n4", 4, 4, 42.75226042800932], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Then, \"some of the biggest names\" suggests that well-known and respected individuals are involved, which is a positive point.\n\nThe phrase continues with \"with impressive results.\" The word \"impressive\" definitely has a positive connotation. It indicates that whatever they did resulted in something noteworthy or successful. So putting it all together, the sentence is highlighting a positive outcome from bringing together notable figures in Japanese anime.\n\nThere's no negative language here. Words like \"biggest names\" and \"impressive results\" are clearly positive indicators. The overall tone seems to be appreciative of the effort and its outcomes. \n\nI don't see any neutral elements that might bring it down to a 2. The use of \"impressive\" leans more towards a higher positive sentiment rather than just being average or neutral.\n\nSo considering all this, the sentiment is very positive.

The user wants me to classify it into one of five categories: 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), or 4 (very positive).

It seems like someone is suggesting that robots should be built and taken to a theater for a late show. They're referencing Mystery Science Theater 3000, which is a show where characters watch and make fun of bad movies. So the suggestion here is to create a tribute by mocking a movie.\n\nNow, focusing on the sentiment. The key part is \"what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie.\" Using words like \"worst\" and \"only\" in this context are clearly negative. They're implying that this movie isn't just bad but is the epitome of a terrible film, especially in its category (likely a killer website movie).\n\nThe mention of putting on a tribute in the style of Mystery Science Theater 3000 suggests that the intention is to mock or parody the movie because it's so bad. This adds another layer of negativity because it's not just about disliking the film but also using humor at its expense.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the sentiment here is negative. The use of \"worst\" and the context of mocking indicate a strong dislike for the movie. I don't see any positive or neutral elements in this text; everything points towards a negative view.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is clearly negative due to the use of terms like \"worst\" and the implication that the movie is being mocked, which adds to the negativity.\n\n1", 1, 0, 44.74297528000898], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is about Brian Tufano's photography and Paul Grabowsky's music turning a \"fairly parochial melodrama\" into something \"really rather special.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the words used. \"Handsome widescreen photography\" sounds positive, as \"handsome\" means attractive or visually appealing. Similarly, \"excellent music\" is clearly a compliment. The movie itself is described as a \"fairly parochial melodrama,\" which I think means it's quite local or maybe even small in scope, but the use of \"parochial\" could sometimes have a negative connotation implying narrow-mindedness. However, the overall sentiment seems to be turning this into something special, so that's positive.\n\nThe phrase \"turn this... into something really rather special\" indicates that despite its initial limitations, the result is very good. So even though it starts with a slightly negative adjective (\"parochial\"), the transformation makes it stand out positively.\n\nI should consider how strong these positive words are. Words like \"excellent,\" \"handsome,\" and \"special\" are all quite strong in their positivity. The structure of the sentence shows that despite the movie being parochial, which might not be a compliment on its own, the contributions from Tufano and Grabowsky elevate it to something special.\n\nSo putting this together, the sentiment is positive because the focus is on how the photography and music make the film stand out. The negative aspect (\"parochial\") is outweighed by the praise for the technical elements, leading to an overall positive sentiment.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 4, 34.7147586249921], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Not making fun suggests respect or kindness, adding to the positive sentiment.\n\nThen it says, \"he's not laughing at them.\" Again, this reinforces that Smith is considerate and not being mean-spirited. The absence of negative behavior here contributes to an overall positive view.\n\nI should also consider the structure. The text starts with a direct expression of liking someone and then provides reasons why, both of which are positive attributes. There's no negative language or implication here\u2014no complaints or dislikes mentioned.\n\nLooking at the words used: 'like,' 'not making fun,' 'not laughing at.' All these indicate approval and positivity. The speaker is happy with Smith's behavior towards others, showing that Smith is respectful and kind.\n\nI don't see any neutral elements that would suggest a middle ground; the sentiment clearly leans positive. It doesn't go into superlatives or extreme praise, so it might not be 'very positive,' but definitely more than just a little positive.\n\nTherefore, considering all these points, I think the sentiment is positive but not extremely so.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the words used. \"Heavy-handed\" usually has a negative connotation; it suggests that something is overly done or clumsy. Then, \"navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness.\" The term \"fade into\" here doesn't seem positive. Pomposity means being self-important in a silly way, and pretentiousness is about making things seem more important than they are, which is generally seen as negative.\n\nSo the text is talking about the movie's screenplay becoming overly dramatic or taking itself too seriously in an unappealing way. Words like \"pomposity\" and \"pretentiousness\" definitely carry negative meanings. Therefore, the sentiment expressed here seems to be negative.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive.

The sentence is: \"too often , son of the bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained 'big moment' will occur and not 'if .'\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the text is saying. It seems like it's talking about a movie or maybe a play called \"Son of the Bride.\" The user is mentioning that too often, this piece becomes an exercise in predicting when a big moment will happen, rather than if it will happen. \n\nSo, breaking it down: the phrase \"too often\" suggests something happens frequently which might be a negative aspect. Then they say it's an \"exercise in trying to predict when a preordained 'big moment' will occur.\" The word \"preordained\" implies that this big moment is expected or fated, maybe making the story predictable.\n\nThe structure of the sentence seems critical because it points out that the focus is on predicting timing rather than whether something happens. This could mean that the narrative lacks suspense or surprise because the outcome is too predictable. \n\nIn terms of sentiment, pointing out predictability in a creative work like a movie or play can be seen as negative feedback. It suggests that the story isn't engaging because it's too formulaic. So the overall tone here seems to be negative.\n\nNow, considering the scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). The statement is critical but not excessively so; it's pointing out a flaw without being overly harsh. Therefore, I'd rate this as 1, which stands for negative.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative because it criticizes the predictability of the narrative, indicating dissatisfaction with the lack of suspense or surprise.\n\nOutput: 1", 1, 1, 35.87146933900658], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase \"feels as immediate as the latest news footage from Gaza\" suggests that the content being discussed has a current, pressing feel to it, which can be neutral but in this context seems to highlight its relevance and impact.\n\nThen, \"because of its heightened, well-shaped dramas\" indicates that the dramas are intense and well-structured. This is positive because it praises both the intensity (heightened) and the quality (well-shaped) of the dramas. Finally, saying it's \"twice as powerful\" clearly emphasizes a strong positive sentiment.\n\nPutting this all together, each descriptive phrase contributes positively to the overall tone.

The text is praising the subject\u2014likely a film or documentary about Israel\u2014and highlighting its emotional impact and well-crafted elements.\n\nI don't see any neutral terms that might temper the positivity; instead, each adjective adds to a very positive assessment. Therefore, the sentiment expressed is definitely on the higher end of positivity.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses positive adjectives like \"fascinating,\" \"heightened,\" \"well-shaped,\" and describes the content as \"twice as powerful.\" This indicates a strong positive sentiment.\n\n4", 4, 4, 39.17623811800149], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Then it says they're \"perfectly constructed,\" which also sounds very positive. The phrases \"convey a sense of childhood imagination\" and \"creating adventure out of angst\" seem to add more positivity because imagination and adventure are generally viewed as good things, especially when tied to childhood.\n\nSo putting this all together, the sentiment is definitely positive. Now I need to decide if it's just 3 (positive) or 4 (very positive). The words \"well done\" and \"perfectly constructed\" are strong compliments, which lean towards a higher score. Also, the way it describes creating adventure from angst adds depth, showing that the animation effectively conveys something meaningful beyond just being entertaining.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. Everything points to a positive sentiment. Therefore, I think 4 is appropriate because it's not just positive but strongly so with the use of such approving adjectives.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence uses strong positive adjectives like \"well done\" and \"perfectly constructed,\" along with themes of imagination and adventure, indicating a very positive sentiment.\n\n4", 4, 4, 31.259448252996663], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text given is: \"there is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us .\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to understand each part. \n\nThe first part says, \"there is no solace here.\" Solace means comfort or consolation, so saying there's none suggests that whatever is being discussed isn't providing comfort. That seems negative.\n\nNext, it mentions, \"no entertainment value.\" Entertainment usually makes people happy or engaged, so not having that would be a downside. Again, this leans towards negative sentiment.\n\nThen the text says, \"merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us.\" The word \"fierce\" here might imply something intense or harsh. A lesson could be seen as positive if it's insightful, but paired with \"fierce,\" it might come off as more of a strong warning rather than an encouraging message.\n\nPutting this together, the overall tone seems to be critical or disapproving. The person is pointing out that whatever they're talking about (probably a film) doesn't offer comfort or entertainment but instead gives a harsh lesson. This could indicate dissatisfaction with how the film was made or its content.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any positive nuance here. While \"fierce lesson\" might have some depth, the preceding negatives about solace and entertainment value weigh it down. The overall sentiment doesn't seem extremely negative but still leans towards being negative rather than neutral or positive.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 1, 34.258651757001644], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence given is: \"Even if it is generally amusing from time to time, I Spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the sentence. It starts with a positive note by saying that something is \"generally amusing\" and happens \"from time to time.\" So, there's a part where it acknowledges some fun or enjoyment. But then the tone changes when it mentions that \"I Spy has all the same problems,\" which implies that despite moments of amusement, the movie suffers from common issues found in action comedies.\n\nNow, I need to consider whether this overall sentiment is negative, positive, neutral, etc. The first part is somewhat positive, but the second part is definitely pointing out flaws or negatives about the movie. The use of \"all the same problems\" suggests that these are recurring and perhaps significant issues. \n\nI wonder if the negative aspects outweigh the positive ones here. Even though it's amusing sometimes, the mention of having all the same problems might indicate a critical view. It feels like the speaker is saying that while there are moments of enjoyment, overall, the movie isn't great because it falls into typical traps.\n\nSo, considering the scale from 0 to 4 where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, I need to decide where this sentiment lands. The positive aspect is minor, and the negative critique seems more prominent. Therefore, it's probably not neutral (2). It might be slightly negative but perhaps not extremely so because there was some positive mention.\n\nI'm thinking maybe a 1 for negative since it's pointing out problems despite some positives. Alternatively, if I consider that the criticism is somewhat tempered by the initial positivity, maybe it's closer to neutral or even slightly negative. But given the emphasis on the problems, I think it leans more towards being negative than positive.\n\nWait, but the first part does say \"generally amusing,\" which suggests an overall positive leaning despite some flaws. However, the second part is a strong criticism that could dominate the sentiment. It's a bit tricky because there are both elements present.\n\nPerhaps another angle: action comedies often have predictable issues, so by pointing that out, it might be a fair critique without being overly harsh. The sentiment isn't extremely negative, just pointing out common problems. So maybe it's not a 0 or even a 1. Maybe it's closer to neutral (2) because while there are negatives, the positives are acknowledged.\n\nWait, but the structure of the sentence starts with a positive and then contradicts it with a negative, which might mean the overall sentiment is more on the negative side. The phrase \"has all the same problems\" could indicate frustration or disappointment, making the sentiment lean towards negative.\n\nI think I'll go with 1 as the sentiment score because while there's some positivity, the criticism seems to be the main point of the sentence.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 1, 57.856709807994775], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let's break down the given sentence step by step.\n\nThe sentence starts with \"I've never seen -lrb- a remake -rrb- do anything as stomach-turning...\" So right away, it mentions a remake in a negative light. The phrase \"stomach-turning\" is definitely a strong negative adjective. It means something that causes disgust or discomfort, so that's leaning towards very negative.\n\nNext part: \"...as the way Adam Sandler's new movie rapes, pillages and incinerates Frank Capra's classic...\" Oh wow, this is loaded with strong language. \"Rapes\" and \"pillages\" are both highly aggressive verbs, often used metaphorically to describe something being treated poorly or destructively. \"Incinerates\" adds another layer of intensity, implying complete destruction.\n\nPutting it all together, the speaker is expressing intense dislike for Adam Sandler's remake, comparing it unfavorably to Frank Capra's original classic. The use of such harsh verbs and adjectives suggests a strong negative sentiment. There's no neutral or positive language here; everything points towards a very negative view.\n\nSo considering the scale, 0 is very negative, which seems appropriate because the sentiment expressed is quite harsh and critical. It doesn't just dislike it; it despises how the remake handles the original work.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses strongly negative language to criticize Adam Sandler's remake, comparing it unfavorably to Frank Capra's classic with intense verbs like \"rapes,\" \"pillages,\" and \"incinerates.\" This indicates a very negative sentiment.\n\n0", 0, 0, 36.075141646986594], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text provided is \"like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions.\" \n\nHmm, so first I need to understand what each number represents in terms of sentiment. 0 is very negative, which would involve strong dislike or anger. 1 is negative but not as intense. 2 is neutral, meaning neither positive nor negative. 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive.\n\nLooking at the text, it's about leafing through an album with photos and captions that are \"sketchy.\" The word \"sketchiest\" here is a bit tricky. It could mean the captions are of low quality or perhaps they're just brief or not very detailed. I don't immediately get a negative emotion from it, but neither does it seem overly positive.\n\nSo, what's the sentiment here? It sounds like someone is describing an experience that isn't particularly bad or good. They might be reminiscing or looking at old photos without any strong emotions attached. The use of \"like\" suggests a comparison rather than a direct statement of feeling.\n\nI should also consider if \"sketchy\" has a negative connotation. It can sometimes imply something is rough, incomplete, or unreliable. But in this context, it's more about the captions being simple or not elaborate. There's no indication that they're offensive or harmful, just perhaps not very informative or detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, there's no clear positive or negative emotion expressed here. The focus is on the act of looking through photos with captions, which doesn't inherently carry a strong sentiment either way.

The text is: \"Unambitious writing emerges in the movie, using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook.\" \n\nFirst, let's break it down. The main words here are \"unambitious\" and \"emerges.\" The term \"unambitious\" clearly has a negative connotation because it suggests that the writing lacks ambition or originality. So right away, I'm sensing some negativity.\n\nNext, the phrase \"using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook\" seems to be pointing out that the plot is clich\u00e9 or derivative. This also leans towards negative because it implies predictability and lack of creativity, which are not favorable traits in storytelling.\n\nPutting these together, the overall sentiment is negative. The sentence isn't just a neutral observation; it's making a critical point about the writing being unambitious and the plot being generic. So, I think this should be classified as a negative sentiment.\n\nNow, looking at the scale: 0 for very negative, 1 for negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. Since the sentence is clearly critical but not extremely so, it's probably a 1 (negative). It doesn't use strong language like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" which might warrant a 0.

The key parts are:\n\n1. \"bracing truth\" \u2013 Bracing usually means something that's bold or strong, perhaps a bit harsh but in a good way. Truth suggests authenticity.\n2. \"refreshing\" \u2013 This is clearly positive. It means it brings a new, invigorating perspective.\n3. \"phoniness of female-bonding pictures\" \u2013 Phoniness implies insincerity or artificiality. So the comparison is against other works that are seen as fake.\n\nPutting it together, the text seems to praise \"me without you\" for its authenticity and truthfulness compared to other female-bonding movies which are seen as phony. The use of \"refreshing\" adds a positive spin on how this movie stands out from the others.\n\nSo, considering the sentiment scale: 0 is very negative, 4 very positive.

It doesn't reach an extreme like 4 (which might require more effusive praise), but it's definitely on the positive side, probably a 3.\n\nI don't see any negative words about \"me without you\" itself; the only negativity is directed towards other works.

The phrase starts with \"a pointed, often tender, examination.\" \"Pointed\" suggests that it's direct or sharp in its approach, which can sometimes imply criticism but not necessarily negative sentiment on its own. \"Tender\" is definitely a positive word, meaning gentle or compassionate. So together, this part seems to be neutral to slightly positive because while it's pointed (maybe critical), it's also tender.\n\nNext, looking at the subject of the examination: \"the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties.\" This shows that the text is discussing both the positives and negatives of these topics. It's not one-sided; instead, it's presenting a balanced view. That balance often leads to a neutral sentiment because it's neither overly positive nor negative.\n\nPutting it all together, \"pointed\" could be seen as critical but balanced with \"tender,\" making the overall tone neutral.

The exclamation mark adds emphasis, which can make the sentiment stronger.\n\nI should consider if there are any negative words or context that might affect the sentiment, but in this case, there aren't any negative indicators. It's straightforward with a positive word and an intensifier punctuation.\n\nSo, putting it together, \"educational\" is positive, and the exclamation mark makes it more so. Therefore, the sentiment is likely positive.

But then there's a contrast with \"but,\" which might indicate a shift in sentiment.\n\nThe second part mentions \"little moments give it a boost.\" Boosting usually implies something positive, so this seems like a positive statement. The word \"little\" doesn't make it less positive; instead, it shows that even small things contributed positively.\n\nPutting it together: the first part is neutral or slightly negative because there's no surprise, which might imply predictability. But the second part adds a positive element with those little boosts. So overall, the sentiment leans more towards positive but not extremely so.\n\nI think 3 (positive) fits here because while there's a mix of neutral and positive elements, the emphasis is on the positive moments making it better.\n</think>\n\nThe text combines a neutral observation with a positive note, leaning toward positivity without being overly enthusiastic.

My output needs to be just one integer: 0 for very negative, 1 for negative, 2 for neutral, 3 for positive, or 4 for very positive.\n\nFirst, I'll read the provided text carefully. It says, \"an unforgettable look at morality , family , and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage.\" The words here are \"unforgettable,\" \"morality,\" \"family,\" \"social expectation,\" \"prism,\" \"omnibus tradition,\" and \"marriage.\"\n\nBreaking it down, \"unforgettable\" is a strong positive adjective, suggesting something memorable in a good way. It's often used to highlight something that stands out positively. Then we have themes like morality, family, and social expectations, which are neutral topics on their own but can be explored in both positive and negative contexts.\n\nThe phrase \"through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage\" uses \"prism,\" which typically implies a multifaceted view, suggesting depth and complexity. The word \"omnibus\" here might mean comprehensive or all-encompassing, indicating that marriage is being examined from various angles. The term \"called marriage\" seems neutral but in context, it ties together the themes mentioned earlier.\n\nPutting it all together, the text doesn't explicitly state a negative sentiment. Instead, it presents an exploration of significant and often sensitive topics through the lens of marriage, which is generally considered a positive institution, albeit with its challenges. The use of \"unforgettable\" leans towards a positive evaluation, but there's no overtly positive language beyond that.\n\nConsidering the scale, 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit here. 1 is negative; again, not applicable as there's nothing negative mentioned. Neutral (2) could be a possibility because it's discussing serious topics without clear sentiment. However, \"unforgettable\" suggests something impactful, likely on the positive side but not extremely so.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards 3, which is positive.

Let me read through the sentence again: \"the movie's messages are quite admirable, but the story is just too clich\u00e9d and too often strains credulity.\"\n\nFirst, I notice there are two main parts here. The first part says that the movie's messages are \"quite admirable.\" That sounds positive because admirable means something praiseworthy or worthy of respect. So that gives a positive sentiment.\n\nBut then it uses the word \"but,\" which usually indicates a contrast or a negative point coming up. The next part talks about the story being \"too clich\u00e9d\" and \"strains credulity.\" Clich\u00e9d means overused, so it's not original, which is generally seen as a negative trait in storytelling. Straining credulity means that it's hard to believe, which can make the story less engaging or enjoyable.\n\nSo breaking it down: positive about messages, negative about the story. Now I need to figure out if the overall sentiment leans more towards positive or negative.\n\nThe sentence starts with a compliment but then immediately follows up with significant criticisms. The use of \"quite\" in the first part adds some strength to the positive comment, but the negatives are described as \"too\" which emphasizes their drawbacks. So while there's an appreciation for one aspect, the other aspects are seen as problematic.\n\nI think overall, the sentiment is mixed, but since it starts with a compliment and then more strongly criticizes the story, maybe the negative points have a stronger impact. However, because both positive and negative aspects are present without leaning heavily in either direction, it might be neutral.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes when people mention positives but also strong negatives, especially if they're more impactful, the overall sentiment could still be considered as having a slight negative tilt. But I'm not sure. Since there's a balance between the two, perhaps it's neutral.\n\nWait, another thought: The positive part is about messages being admirable, which is important in movies, but the story being clich\u00e9d and hard to believe might overshadow that because storytelling is a core element. So maybe the overall sentiment leans more negative because even though there's some praise, the main criticism hits harder.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit torn. The user instruction says to output 0-4 based on negativity or positivity. If it's very positive or very negative, but here it's mixed. Maybe neutral is safer because both sides are presented without one clearly dominating. Alternatively, perhaps slightly negative because the negatives about the story are stronger.\n\nI think I'll go with neutral (2) because while there are negatives, they don't completely outweigh the positives, and the sentence balances them out.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 1, 53.63872245300445], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence is: \"Instead of panoramic sweep, Kapur gives us episodic choppiness, undermining the story's emotional thrust.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break it down. The user mentions two phrases here: \"panoramic sweep\" and \"episodic choppiness.\" From what I know, a \"panoramic sweep\" usually refers to a broad, comprehensive view or approach, which is often seen as positive because it suggests depth and thoroughness. On the other hand, \"episodic choppiness\" sounds less favorable. The word \"choppiness\" implies something that's disjointed or uneven, which can be negative in context.\n\nThe sentence also says that this approach \"undermines the story's emotional thrust.\" Undermine is a strong verb here; it suggests that something is weakening or damaging the story's emotional impact. So putting it together, the speaker seems to be criticizing Kapur for not providing a comprehensive narrative but instead making it episodic and disjointed, which in turn weakens the story emotionally.\n\nNow, considering sentiment classification: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The text is clearly expressing dissatisfaction or criticism. It's not just a mild critique but points out that the approach undermines the emotional thrust, which is significant. So this seems more than just a negative sentiment; it's quite strong in its negativity.\n\nTherefore, I think the sentiment here should be classified as 0, very negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text criticizes Kapur's approach, indicating dissatisfaction and pointing out weaknesses in the story's emotional impact, thus expressing a very negative sentiment. \n\nAnswer: 0", 0, 1, 35.82383523299359], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Then there's a \"murder mystery,\" which can be intriguing but might also carry some negative connotations due to the crime aspect.\n\nThe latter part says, \"that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence.\" The words \"deep deceptions\" and \"innocence\" suggest complexity or perhaps a darker twist. Meditation here implies reflection, maybe even some introspection that could be thought-provoking but not necessarily negative.\n\nPutting it all together: The text describes elements that are both positive (love story) and neutral to slightly negative (murder mystery, deceptions of innocence). However, the overall tone doesn't lean heavily in one direction. It seems balanced, more descriptive than emotionally charged.

Using strong language like \"junk\" indicates frustration, but it's not an extremely harsh word. The phrase doesn't have any positive connotations. It's purely about wasted time and disappointment. \n\nSo, on the scale provided, very negative would be 0. Since they're expressing clear dissatisfaction without extreme vehemence, maybe a 1 is appropriate for negative. But wait, \"junk\" isn't just neutral; it's definitely negative because it implies something of low quality or value. Therefore, I think the sentiment here leans towards negative but not extremely so.\n\nI should also consider if there's any ambiguity. The phrase doesn't express extreme anger or sadness, just frustration and disappointment. Hence, a 1 seems right as it's on the negative side without being very negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses clear dissatisfaction with something that took up two hours, using \"junk\" to indicate worthlessness. This is a negative sentiment but not extremely so.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 0, 31.23610587697476], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is: \"(kirshner wins , but it 's close . )\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. \"Kirshner wins\" \u2013 this part seems straightforward. If someone wins, that's generally a positive outcome. So that would lean towards a positive sentiment.\n\nHowever, the next part says \"but it's close.\" The word \"close\" implies that the victory wasn't by a large margin. It was a narrow win. Now, is a narrow win considered more positive or could it have some negative connotations?\n\nIn some contexts, winning closely might still be seen as positive because the person did win. But sometimes, people might feel that a close win isn't as impressive as a decisive victory. So there's a bit of ambiguity here.\n\nLooking at the structure: \"Kirshner wins\" is the main point, and \"but it's close\" adds a caveat. The use of \"but\" suggests a contrast between the two statements. It might be that the speaker acknowledges the win but is somewhat underwhelmed because it wasn't a landslide.\n\nSo considering this, the sentiment isn't extremely positive because of the \"close\" part, which slightly dampens the positivity. But since it's still a win, it's not negative either. Therefore, I would classify this as neutral or maybe leaning slightly towards positive but not very positive.\n\nComparing to the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. Since there are elements of positivity (winning) and a slight dampening (\"close\"), it's probably around neutral to somewhat positive. But given that the victory was close, maybe it doesn't reach a full positive sentiment.\n\nI think 2 (neutral) is the most accurate here because while there's a win, the closeness might not necessarily make it very positive. Alternatively, some might see it as slightly positive but not strongly so.\n</think>\n\nThe text mentions a win but notes that it was close, which introduces a nuance that prevents it from being very positive.

The sentence is: \"one of the most highly-praised disappointments i've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time.\" \n\nFirst, I notice that the word \"disappointments\" is a strong indicator. Disappointment usually has a negative connotation, so that's pointing towards a negative sentiment.\n\nThen there's \"highly-praised,\" which might seem positive at first glance because praise is good. However, it's used in this context to describe the disappointment. So maybe it means that despite being praised by others, the person found it disappointing, which adds to the negative feeling.\n\nThe phrase \"had the misfortune to watch\" also has a negative tone. Misfortune implies that watching it was an unlucky experience, contributing to the overall negativity.\n\nPutting it all together: the sentiment expressed is definitely negative because of words like 'disappointment,' 'misfortune,' and the context suggesting something that was expected to be good but turned out bad. \n\nSo on the scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive), I'd say this text is a 1, which represents negative.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the given text is negative due to the use of words like \"disappointments,\" \"misfortune,\" and the context indicating a disappointing experience despite praise.\n\nOutput: 1", 1, 0, 28.542939820006723], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user wants just that number as output, but first, I need to understand what each score represents. \n\nSo, 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 is neutral, 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive. Now, looking at the text itself: \"a slick, engrossing melodrama.\" Let's break it down word by word.\n\nFirst, \"slick\" usually has a positive connotation. It can mean something that's smooth or polished, which in the context of a movie or story could imply it's well-made or stylish. Next is \"engrossing,\" which means holding one's attention completely\u2014so this suggests that whatever is being talked about is really engaging and compelling.\n\nNow, considering \"melodrama.\" This term can sometimes have a negative connotation because it often refers to dramas with exaggerated emotions or situations, which some people might find over-the-top. However, in the context of entertainment, especially when paired with positive adjectives like \"slick\" and \"engrossing,\" it might just be describing the genre without any negative judgment.\n\nPutting it all together: \"slick\" is positive, \"engrossing\" is positive, and \"melodrama\" is neutral to slightly positive in this context. The overall sentiment seems positive because both adjectives used are complimentary. \n\nI don't think it's extremely positive (which would be 4) because there aren't superlatives like \"incredible\" or \"amazing.\" It's just a solid positive, so probably a 3.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses positive adjectives like \"slick\" and \"engrossing,\" indicating an overall positive sentiment. \n\nAnswer: 3", 3, 4, 38.20804427601979], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text provided is \"this isn't a movie; it's a symptom.\" \n\nFirst, I'll read the sentence carefully. It starts by saying that something isn't a movie, which could imply disappointment because maybe the person expected a movie but got something else. Then they compare it to a \"symptom,\" which might refer to something negative or concerning. Symptoms are usually signs of an illness or problem, so using that term here likely has a negative connotation.\n\nI should consider the context in which this sentence is used. If someone is talking about a film and says it's not a movie but a symptom, they're probably criticizing it harshly. Maybe they think the content is more like a reflection of societal issues rather than an entertainment piece, which could be seen as negative if the intent was to enjoy a movie.\n\nThe tone here seems critical and perhaps even disgusted. The use of \"isn't\" emphasizes that it fails to meet expectations. Comparing it to a symptom suggests that it's not just bad but indicative of something deeper or problematic. \n\nI don't see any positive words or sentiments in the text. There's no indication of approval or satisfaction. Instead, there's clear disappointment and a negative comparison.\n\nSo, considering all this, the sentiment is definitely negative. Now, deciding between 0 (very negative) and 1 (negative). The use of \"symptom\" might indicate a more intense criticism, suggesting it's not just bad but perhaps indicative of a larger issue. That could lean towards very negative, which is 0. However, sometimes \"symptom\" isn't as extreme as other terms. It depends on how strong the comparison is perceived.\n\nAlternatively, if the person is simply expressing disappointment without extreme language, it might be 1 (negative). But given that they're framing it as a symptom rather than just a bad movie, I think it's leaning towards more intense negativity.\n</think>\n\n0", 0, 1, 42.442711424984736], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user is asking me to classify it as 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), or 4 (very positive). \n\nLooking at the text: \"tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare , unchecked heartache of yasujiro ozu.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the sentence starts with \"tsai has managed to create,\" which sounds positive because it uses words like \"managed\" and \"create,\" implying success. Then it describes the work as an \"underplayed melodrama.\" Underplayed can sometimes mean subtle or not over-the-top, which might be seen as a good thing in some contexts.\n\nNext, it mentions family dynamics and dysfunction. Family dysfunction is generally a negative topic, but in this context, it's about how Tsai portrayed it, so maybe that's considered well-done rather than the subject itself being negative.\n\nThen it compares this to Yasujiro Ozu's work, saying it harks back to his \"spare, unchecked heartache.\" Yasujiro Ozu is known for his subtle and emotional films, often dealing with family themes. So comparing Tsai's work to Ozu\u2019s might be a compliment, suggesting depth and emotional resonance.\n\nPutting it all together: The text seems to appreciate Tsai's ability to create a nuanced melodrama that effectively portrays difficult family dynamics in a way reminiscent of a respected filmmaker. There's no overtly negative language here; instead, it's more analytical and complimentary.\n\nSo, the sentiment is positive but not extremely so. It doesn't use superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"extraordinary,\" but rather acknowledges the skillful portrayal. Therefore, I think it falls into a 3, which is positive.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 2, 40.620266261015786], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It's talking about Gary Burns, a Canadian filmmaker, and his take on something. The adjectives used are \"inventive\" and \"mordantly humorous.\" Then it describes the subject as \"the soullessness of work in the city.\"\n\nLet me think about each part:\n\n1. \"Inventive\": This is generally a positive word. It suggests creativity and originality.\n2. \"Mordantly humorous\": Mordant usually means biting or sarcastic humor, often with a critical edge. So it's a bit dark but still funny. The use of 'humorous' here leans positive, but the 'mordant' adds a slightly negative twist because it implies criticism.\n3. \"Soullessness of work in the city\": This part is definitely negative. Soullessness suggests emptiness or lack of fulfillment, which are negative connotations.\n\nSo putting it all together: The filmmaker's approach is creative and funny, but the topic itself is about the soullessness of work, which is a negative subject. \n\nI need to weigh these elements. On one hand, the adjectives used to describe the take are positive, indicating that Gary Burns presents his perspective in an inventive and humorous way. On the other hand, the content he's discussing (soullessness) is negative.\n\nIs the sentiment more about how he presents it or the subject itself? I think both factors contribute. The presentation is positive because of 'inventive' and 'humorous,' but the underlying message is negative about work in the city.\n\nI'm trying to determine if the overall sentiment leans more towards positive or negative. Since the text highlights his creative approach, which are positive traits, but it's about a negative topic. So there's a mix here.\n\nIn terms of the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. Given that the method of presentation (inventive and humorous) is positive, but the subject matter is negative, I might lean towards a neutral or slightly negative sentiment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more about how the filmmaker's approach makes the message more palatable. So even though the topic is negative, the way he presents it is creative and funny, which could make the overall sentiment somewhat positive because it's engaging despite the gloomy subject.\n\nWait, but does the text imply approval or disapproval? It doesn't explicitly say whether Gary Burns agrees with the soullessness or if he's critiquing it. The use of 'mordantly humorous' suggests a critique, perhaps pointing out the issue in a sharp way.\n\nSo combining creative presentation (positive) and critical content (negative), I think the sentiment is neutral because there are both positive and negative elements balancing each other. Therefore, the output should be 2.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is neutral because it combines positive adjectives describing the filmmaker's approach with a negative critique of the subject matter.\n\nOutput: 2", 2, 4, 68.47175904500182], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The first part says you don't need to know certain things (probably about different people or characters) to realize something. So it's setting up a point that's universally applicable.\n\nThen it mentions \"these shootings,\" which immediately makes me think of negative events\u2014violence, tragedy, and loss. That already leans towards a negative sentiment because shootings are generally bad occurrences.\n\nNext, the phrase \"something is rotten in the state of California.\" This is a reference to Shakespeare's Hamlet, where something is wrong or corrupt. Using this metaphor indicates that there's an underlying issue or corruption, which is definitely a negative statement.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence is pointing out that regardless of specific knowledge (like knowing about Ice-T or Cool J), one can see that California has significant problems related to shootings. The use of \"rotten\" and referencing a corrupt state strongly suggests a negative sentiment.\n\nI don't see any positive words here. It's entirely focused on highlighting issues, so the sentiment is negative. On the scale provided, 0 is very negative, 1 is negative.

Then, \"portrait of the self-esteem of employment\"\u2014self-esteem related to work is important, so losing that could be significant. The next part mentions \"the shame of losing a job.\" Shame is definitely a negative emotion.\n\nPutting it together, the text seems to focus on the emotional impact of job loss, specifically the loss of self-esteem and feelings of shame. While it's described as introspective, which can sometimes be neutral or even positive in a reflective sense, the mention of shame tilts it towards a more negative sentiment. However, since the words aren't extremely harsh (like \"devastating\" or \"terrible\"), it might not reach a 0.\n\nSo considering all that, I think this is more on the negative side but not extremely so.

It refers to something being unclear or not making sense, which generally has a negative connotation. The word \"reigns\" suggests that this incoherence is dominant or prevalent. So the sentence implies chaos or lack of order, which isn't positive.\n\nNow, considering sentiment scores: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, and so on. Since \"incoherence reigns\" is a strong statement about disorder, it's definitely negative but not extremely so. It doesn't express anger or extreme displeasure, just a sense of things being out of control.\n\nSo, I think the sentiment here would be negative but not the most severe.

The phrase \"almost bergmanesque intensity\" refers to something intense, reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman's work, which is known for being deep and serious, but not necessarily negative. So that part sets a strong emotional tone.\n\nNext, looking at the second part: \"bisset is both convincing and radiant.\" Convincing suggests that Bisset's performance was believable and effective, which is positive. Radiant implies glowing or bright, adding another layer of positivity. \n\nPutting it together, the text seems to praise Bisset's acting. The words used are complimentary without any negative connotations. Therefore, the sentiment should be positive.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 4 is very positive. Since the text uses strong positive adjectives like \"convincing\" and \"radiant,\" it leans towards a higher score. But I don't think it's extremely exaggerated; it's just a solid positive review. So probably a 3 (positive) rather than 4 (very positive). However, sometimes in sentiment analysis, even without superlatives, the use of clearly positive words can tip it to 3 or 4.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if \"bergmanesque intensity\" could have any negative implications. Bergman's films are often serious and intense but not inherently negative. They deal with deep themes, which might be seen as intense but not bad. So that part doesn't affect the positivity negatively.\n\nTherefore, combining the positive descriptors of Bisset's performance, I think a 3 (positive) is appropriate here.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses positive adjectives like \"convincing\" and \"radiant,\" indicating a favorable sentiment without extreme language.

The phrase starts with \"open-ended,\" which generally has a positive connotation because it suggests something that's versatile or allows for multiple perspectives. Then it says \"composed of layer upon layer.\" That makes me think of depth and complexity, which are often seen as positives, especially in art or literature.\n\nNext, the text refers to \"a cinephile's feast.\" A cinephile is someone who loves movies deeply, so calling something a feast for them implies that it's rich, satisfying, and enjoyable. That definitely sounds positive.\n\nThen it mentions \"an invitation to countless interpretations.\" This suggests that the film invites analysis and offers various ways to understand it, which is often praised in films because it makes them more engaging and thought-provoking. People usually appreciate works that allow for multiple layers of interpretation as they can be revisited and offer new insights each time.\n\nPutting all this together: open-endedness, layered composition, being a feast for movie lovers, and inviting interpretations.

But then it says \"could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire.\" Satire can sometimes have negative connotations depending on context.\n\nThe next part is crucial: \"but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .\" The word \"lacks\" indicates something missing. So, they're pointing out that this movie doesn't have a key element (generous inclusiveness) of its genre. They also mention that while the genre has this feature, it's described as \"disingenuous,\" which means insincere or deceitful.\n\nPutting it together: The reviewer is saying the movie isn't quite what it could be because it's missing an important aspect of its genre. While they acknowledge that the genre's trait exists, they find it insincere. So, there's a bit of criticism here but not overly harsh. It's more of a neutral-negative tone because it's pointing out a deficiency without being extremely negative.\n\nIn the example, the user gave a 2 for neutral. Maybe in this case, since the sentiment is leaning slightly negative due to the \"lacks\" and \"disingenuous,\" perhaps it should be a 1 (negative). But I'm not entirely sure because the first part seems somewhat positive with the nationwide opening, but that's more factual than emotional.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's neutral overall because while there's criticism, it's balanced by the fact that it could almost fit into the genre. So perhaps the sentiment is slightly negative but not strongly so, hence a 1 or 2.

The sentence starts with \"The emperor's club,\" which is a movie title, so this seems like a review or critique of that film. The next part says it's \"ruthless in its own placid way.\" That sounds a bit contradictory because ruthless usually has a negative connotation, but \"placid\" means calm or serene. So maybe the reviewer is saying the movie is harshly critical but does so in a calm manner.\n\nThen, they mention that the film finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions. \"Hidebound\" typically refers to something stuck in old ways, not changing, which could be negative if it's criticized for being outdated or rigid. So this part might suggest that the movie is pointing out a flaw in traditional filmmaking.\n\nBut then the sentence flips: it says the film gives these conservative traditions new texture, relevance, and reality. \"New texture\" suggests something fresh or different, adding depth. \"Relevance\" implies it's making something outdated current or meaningful again. \"New reality\" could mean presenting a more accurate or updated perspective. \n\nPutting it together, the reviewer seems to acknowledge that the movie is taking on an old filmmaking tradition but is doing so in a way that breathes new life into it. The initial part might have some criticism (\"ruthless,\" \"hidebound\"), but the latter part is clearly positive about how the film reinvigorates these traditions.\n\nSo the sentiment seems to lean towards positive because despite pointing out some criticisms, the overall effect is praised for bringing something old into a new light. Therefore, I think the sentiment here is positive, which would be a 3.\n</think>\n\nThe text critiques traditional filmmaking but praises how \"The Emperor's Club\" refreshes these traditions. The sentiment is positive.\n\n3", 3, 4, 47.31764674000442], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The first part mentions \"engagingly primitive animated special effects.\" The word \"engagingly\" suggests something positive\u2014it means it's interesting or captures attention in an appealing way. However, \"primitive\" could be a bit tricky. It usually means simple or basic, which might not always be seen as positive, but combined with \"engagingly,\" it might mean that the simplicity is actually charming rather than a drawback.\n\nNext part: \"contribute to a mood that's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion.\" The word \"sustained\" here implies consistency in the mood created by the effects. But then we have \"surprisingly somber.\" Somber usually means serious, gloomy, or melancholic. The use of \"surprisingly\" could indicate that this outcome wasn't expected, but whether that's positive or negative depends on context.\n\nPutting it all together, the first part is positive\u2014engaging effects. The second part talks about a sustained mood leading to a somber conclusion. Somber can be seen as a downer, but in the context of a story or movie, a somber ending might be meaningful and not necessarily negative if it's done well.\n\nSo, considering both parts: the positive description of the effects and the possibly intense emotional impact from the conclusion. The overall sentiment seems neutral because while there are positive elements (\"engagingly primitive\"), there's also a somber tone that doesn't lean too heavily towards positivity or negativity but creates a balanced view.\n\nI think it's not extremely positive (like 4) nor negative (0). It's somewhere in between, so probably a 2 for neutral.\n</think>\n\nThe text describes engaging and primitive effects contributing to a sustained mood leading to a somber conclusion.

That sounds negative because if something is too lengthy, people might find it boring or tedious. Then they mention it \"bogs down,\" which means it slows down or becomes weighed down, adding to the negativity.\n\nThey also talk about a \"surfeit of characters.\" Surfeit means an excess, so having too many characters can make things confusing and overwhelming, which isn't positive. Similarly, \"unnecessary subplots\" implies that there are storylines that aren't needed, which could be distracting or detract from the main plot.\n\nPutting it all together, each part of the sentence is pointing out flaws: lengthiness, too many elements, and unnecessary complexity. These are all negative points about whatever they're discussing. The overall tone seems critical, expressing dissatisfaction with how long and complicated it is.\n\nSo, in terms of sentiment classification:\n0 - Very Negative\n1 - Negative\n2 - Neutral\n3 - Positive\n4 - Very Positive\n\nThe text clearly has a negative sentiment. It's pointing out several issues without any positive remarks. But is it very negative (0) or just negative (1)? The use of words like \"too long,\" \"bogs down,\" and \"unnecessary\" suggests a strong negative feeling, but maybe not the strongest possible. However, since there are multiple criticisms, perhaps it leans more towards 0.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider how intense each criticism is. \"Too long\" could be mild, but combined with the other points, it becomes stronger. Still, without extreme language like \"terrible\" or \"horrible,\" it might not reach very negative. So perhaps a 1 for Negative is more appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to multiple criticisms about length and complexity without any positive aspects.

The phrase \"accomplishes its primary goal\" also sounds positive because it implies success in achieving something intended.\n\nThe text mentions that this was done without special effects but by emphasizing characters, including supporting ones. That's another positive point because it praises the focus on character development over flashy effects, which can be seen as a compliment to the actors and the production quality.\n\nThere are no negative words here. Words like \"emphasizing,\" \"including,\" and \"supporting\" are neutral or slightly positive but in context they contribute positively. The overall tone is appreciative and complimentary.\n\nSo considering all that, it's definitely a positive sentiment. Now, how strong is this positivity? It seems more than just a mild positive; the text is\u8d5e\u8bb8 (praising) the focus on actors and characters without relying on special effects. That suggests a higher level of positivity.\n\nI think 4 (very positive) might be too high unless it's extremely effusive, but this doesn't seem overly exaggerated. It's more of a solid compliment.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the sentence again to get a general sense of the sentiment. \"feardotcom's thrills are all cheap, but they mostly work.\" It seems like the person is talking about something related to fear.com, maybe their products or services, specifically their 'thrills.' \n\nThe first part says that the thrills are all cheap. The word \"cheap\" can have a negative connotation, implying low quality or not worth the price. However, in some contexts, it might be positive if someone is looking for affordable options. But without more context, I think \"cheap\" here leans towards slightly negative because usually when something is described as just \"cheap,\" it's not a compliment.\n\nThen there's a contrast with \"but they mostly work.\" The word \"mostly\" suggests that while the thrills aren't perfect, they generally do what they're supposed to. So this part seems positive. It's saying that despite being cheap, these thrills are effective enough.\n\nPutting it together: The first part is somewhat negative (\"cheap\"), but the second part balances it out by saying they \"mostly work,\" which is a positive statement. So overall, the sentiment isn't entirely negative or positive; it's a mix.\n\nI need to assign this a score from 0 to 4. Let's consider each point:\n\n- If the entire sentence were very negative, like \"feardotcom's thrills are all cheap and don't work,\" that would be closer to 0 or 1.\n- If it were mostly positive, like \"feardotcom's thrills are excellent and well-priced,\" that might be a 3 or 4.\n\nIn this case, the two aspects balance each other. The negative aspect is softened by the positive outcome. So I think the sentiment isn't neutral (2) because there's a slight positivity in the second part. It's more on the positive side but not extremely so. Therefore, it might be a 3 or maybe even a 2.\n\nWait, but let me reconsider. The first part is negative but the second part is positive enough that the overall sentiment isn't just neutral. So perhaps it's leaning towards positive because they do work, which is more important than being cheap. Maybe a 3? Or could it be considered slightly positive?\n\nAlternatively, if \"cheap\" is a significant drawback and only partially redeemed by them working, maybe it's closer to neutral or slightly negative.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. I think the key here is that while they're cheap (possibly implying low quality), they still mostly work. So despite being affordable, they are functional. That might actually be seen as positive because you get something that works without spending much. So maybe it's a 3 for positive but not very high.\n\nWait, no. Because the first part is negative and the second part is positive. The sentence structure uses \"but,\" which often introduces a contrasting point. So the overall sentiment might be more on the positive side because despite being cheap (which could be seen as a downside), they mostly work (the upside). So maybe it's 3.\n\nAlternatively, if someone considers that the thrills are cheap but still effective, that might be a neutral to slightly positive view. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle is to think about how strong each part is. \"Cheap\" is a negative adjective, but \"mostly work\" is a positive outcome. So perhaps it's more of a 2 because the negatives and positives balance out.\n\nWait, another way: if something is cheap but works, people might find that acceptable or even good value. So maybe the sentiment is slightly positive, which would be a 3. Or does \"cheap\" outweigh that?\n\nI think I need to consider common usage. When someone says something is cheap and it works, they often mean it's a good deal. So perhaps the overall sentiment leans towards positive because the functionality compensates for the low price. Therefore, maybe it's a 3.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Maybe I should think of examples. If I say, \"This phone is cheap but mostly works,\" that would likely be a neutral to slightly positive statement because despite being affordable, it functions. So perhaps in this context, the sentiment is more on the positive side, making it a 3.\n\nWait, another perspective: the word \"mostly\" implies that there are some issues, so not everything is perfect. That might bring the positivity down a bit. So maybe it's a 2 because while it's functional, there are flaws, and being cheap could be seen as a negative. But I'm still leaning towards positive because functionality often outweighs cost in sentiment.\n\nAlternatively, if \"cheap\" is perceived as low quality, that could make the overall sentiment neutral or slightly negative. Maybe a 1 or 2.\n\nI think I need to decide: Is the sentence more positive than negative? The second part is\u80af\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u8bf4\u5b83\u4eec mostly work, which might be seen as a stronger statement than just being cheap. So perhaps it's a 3 for positive.\n\nWait, but let me think of the scale:\n\n0: Very Negative\n\n1: Negative\n\n2: Neutral\n\n3: Positive\n\n4: Very Positive\n\nSo if the sentence is pointing out that despite being cheap (negative), they mostly work (positive), then the sentiment is more towards positive because the functionality is highlighted. So maybe a 3.\n\nBut I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, it could be considered neutral since there are both negatives and positives mentioned.\n\nHmm, perhaps considering the structure: \"all cheap\" vs \"mostly work.\" The first part is negative, the second is positive but with a qualifier (\"mostly\"). Since they're contrasting, the sentiment might lean towards the latter. So maybe 2 or 3.\n\nWait, in sentiment analysis, when two opposing sentiments are present, the overall score tends to be closer to neutral unless one aspect dominates. In this case, \"they mostly work\" is the main point after the contrast, so perhaps it's more positive than negative, leading me to think 3.\n\nBut I'm still not 100% sure. Alternatively, if someone says something is cheap but works, they might mean it's a good value, which would be positive, hence 3.\n\nOkay, I'll go with 2 because while there's positivity in them working, the initial negative about being cheap and the qualifier \"mostly\" might make it neutral overall.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is neutral. The sentence points out that while feardotcom's thrills are cheap (a negative aspect), they mostly work (a positive outcome). The use of \"but\" highlights a contrast, suggesting that despite the low cost, functionality is present. However, the mention of them only \"mostly\" working introduces some reservation, preventing it from being strongly positive. Thus, balancing these elements results in a neutral sentiment.\n\n2", 2, 2, 150.30273041300825], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It says something is \"much smarter\" and \"more attentive than it first sets out to be.\" The words \"smarter\" and \"attentive\" are both positive adjectives. Using \"much\" before \"smarter\" emphasizes that it's a significant improvement or higher quality.\n\nThe phrase \"than it first sets out to be\" suggests that the initial expectations were exceeded. So, not only is something smart and attentive, but it surpasses what was originally anticipated. This indicates a positive sentiment because it's highlighting qualities that are favorable beyond the initial assessment.\n\nI don't see any negative words or context here. The overall tone is complimentary. It's definitely not neutral because it's making a positive comparison. So, I need to decide whether this is just positive (3) or very positive (4).

The text is: \"Witherspoon puts to rest her valley-girl image, but it's Dench who really steals the show.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the sentence. It mentions two actors, Witherspoon and Dench. The first part says that Witherspoon has put aside her valley-girl image. Valley-girl usually refers to a certain stereotype or image associated with Southern California culture, which might not always be positive, but in this context, it's more about changing that perception. So putting that image to rest could mean she's moving beyond a previous role or stereotype, which is neutral or slightly positive because it shows growth.\n\nThe second part says Dench \"really steals the show.\" \"Steals the show\" is definitely a positive expression; it means someone stands out or performs exceptionally well. So this part is clearly positive about Dench.\n\nPutting it all together: The sentence talks about two things\u2014Witherspoon changing her image, which is neutral to positive, and Dench doing great work, which is very positive. Since the latter part is more emphasized (using \"but it's...who really steals\"), the overall sentiment leans towards positive. However, it's not extremely effusive or filled with superlatives, so maybe a 3 on the scale.\n\nI should also consider if there are any negative words here. The word \"puts to rest\" isn't negative; it's more about moving past something. There's no overtly negative language, just constructive change and praise.

So this part might be somewhat neutral or slightly positive, depending on how it's presented.\n\nHowever, the sentence then adds \"but explains its characters' decisions only unsatisfactorily.\" This is clearly negative because it points out a flaw in the movie's storytelling\u2014specifically that character motivations aren't clear or well-explained. \n\nPutting it all together: The first part has two negative adjectives, and the latter part adds another criticism.

The film in question is \"Sweet Home Alabama,\" and it's being compared to other films of Witherspoon's. The phrase used here is \"won't be remembered as one of... better films.\" This suggests that the film isn't considered among her better works.\n\nThe word \"certainly\" adds emphasis, making the statement more definitive.

The statement isn't outright saying the film was terrible; instead, it's pointing out that it won't be remembered as one of the better ones.

The statement isn't neutral because it clearly expresses that the film isn't among the better ones, so it can't be neutral. It's not positive either since there's no praise.

The text is: \"even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to understand its components. The subject here is the animation, which is described as both \"hastily\" and \"amateurishly drawn.\" These adjectives carry negative connotations. \"Hastily\" suggests that something was done quickly without much care, implying a lack of quality. Similarly, \"amateurishly\" implies that it's done by someone who isn't a professional, which often means lower quality or skill.\n\nThe sentence also states that this animation cannot engage. Engagement is a positive aspect, so saying it can't engage means the experience is not capturing interest or attention effectively. This adds to the negative sentiment because it's pointing out a failure in achieving an expected outcome.\n\nPutting it all together, the text is criticizing the quality of the animation and its inability to engage, which are both negative points.

It mentions two people: Dan Schneider, a screenwriter, and Shawn Levy, a director. They are substituting \"volume and primary colors\" for \"humor and bite.\" The word \"substitute\" here suggests that instead of using humor and bite (which are qualities often associated with good storytelling or comedy), they're relying on volume and primary colors.\n\nVolume in this context might mean loudness or intensity, perhaps indicating a lack of subtlety. Primary colors are the basic colors like red, blue, and yellow, which could imply simplicity or maybe even something less sophisticated. So substituting these for humor and bite might be implying that their approach is not as effective or engaging.\n\nThe phrase \"for humor and bite\" suggests that humor and having a strong impact (bite) were expected but weren't delivered. Instead, they used more basic elements. This could indicate that the reviewer felt the work was lacking in depth or originality, relying on cheaper effects rather than quality content.\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment words: \"substitute\" here doesn't have a positive connotation; it's more about replacing one thing with another, which is neutral unless context gives it a tone. However, the comparison is between volume/primary colors and humor/bite. Since humor and bite are desirable traits, substituting them could mean that the product lacks these qualities.\n\nSo, putting this together, the sentiment seems negative because it's pointing out a lack of expected quality (humor and bite) and instead using more basic or less effective methods. However, how strong is this negativity? The statement isn't overly harsh; it's more of a criticism than an attack. So maybe not 0 (very negative), but perhaps a 1 (negative). \n\nAlternatively, if someone substitutes volume for humor, they might be trying to compensate in another way without necessarily being very bad. But the use of \"substitute\" implies that the result is less satisfying.

The input text is \"the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the sentence to understand each part. The main points are that the film doesn't find its tone and some scenes are too long. Both of these seem like criticisms. \n\nThe phrase \"never finds its tone\" suggests that the film lacks consistency or direction in its emotional expression. This is a negative point because it implies the movie isn't engaging well. Then, \"several scenes run too long\" indicates pacing issues, which can be frustrating for viewers and is another negative aspect.\n\nSince both parts of the sentence are pointing out flaws without any positive remarks, the overall sentiment should lean towards negative. But how strong is this negativity? The word \"never\" adds a bit of intensity to the first part, making it quite strong. However, there's no superlatives or extreme language beyond that. So, it's not extremely negative but clearly on the negative side.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 is very negative, which might be reserved for more harsh or vitriolic comments. Here, while the points are critical, they don't use strong adjectives like \"awful\" or \"terrible.\" So, I think 1 (negative) fits better because it's a clear criticism without being overly extreme.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to criticisms about the film's tone and pacing.

Neutral is 2, meaning neither positive nor negative. Positive is 3 and very positive is 4.\n\nLooking at the text: \"Norton holds the film together.\" The subject here is Norton, likely referring to an actor or director named Norton. The verb phrase is \"holds the film together,\" which suggests that Norton's performance was essential in making the film cohesive or successful. \n\nIn movie reviews, when someone says a particular person holds the film together, it usually means their contribution was vital and positive. Without them, the film might have been disjointed or less impactful. So this is a compliment towards Norton.\n\nSo considering that, the sentiment is positive. Now, how strong is this positivity? It's not super exaggerated; it's a straightforward statement without any intensifiers like \"amazingly\" or \"incredibly.\" So maybe it's moderately positive rather than extremely so. \n\nBetween 3 (positive) and 4 (very positive), I think 3 would be appropriate here because the sentiment is clearly positive but not overly so. There's no superlatives, just a clear statement of appreciation for Norton's role in the film.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed is positive but not extremely so.

The text is \"the entire cast is first-rate, especially sorvino.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each number represents in terms of sentiment. According to the instructions, 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 is neutral, 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive. My task is to assign one of these numbers based on the text's sentiment.\n\nLooking at the text: \"the entire cast is first-rate, especially sorvino.\" The phrase \"first-rate\" is a strong positive adjective, meaning excellent or top-notch. It shows that the speaker holds the cast in high regard. Additionally, they specifically mention Sorvino, which adds emphasis to their praise, indicating that not only are all members of the cast good, but Sorvino stands out even more.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. The overall tone is clearly positive. So, I should consider whether this sentiment is just positive or very positive. \"First-rate\" is quite strong, suggesting a high level of satisfaction or admiration. The mention of a specific person, Sorvino, being highlighted adds to the intensity of the positive feeling.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment expressed here isn't just neutral (2) or slightly positive (3). It's more than that\u2014it's very positive because of the use of \"first-rate\" and the emphasis on Sorvino. \n\nI should make sure there are no hidden nuances. The text doesn't have any sarcasm or irony, so I can take it at face value. There's nothing indicating a mixed sentiment either; everything points towards a strong positive feeling.\n\nSo, putting it all together: \"first-rate\" and the emphasis on Sorvino indicate a very positive sentiment. That would correspond to 4 in the given scale.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 4, 40.00293872199836], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is: \"it's tommy's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her, and after viewing this one, you'll feel like mopping up, too.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the sentence. It's about Tommy who has a job cleaning peep booths. Peep booths are typically associated with places like adult entertainment venues or arcades where people watch shows or movies through small windows. Cleaning these booths probably involves dealing with trash, spills, maybe even bodily fluids if it's a place where people get intimate.\n\nThe sentence mentions that after viewing this one (probably referring to the booth), someone will feel like mopping up too. Mopping is associated with cleaning, so the implication might be that the booth was really dirty or messy, hence Tommy has to clean it. The phrase \"feel like mopping up\" suggests that the scene inside the booth was so bad or gross that even the viewer would want to clean it.\n\nNow, considering sentiment: The text doesn't express an opinion directly, but it's implying a negative situation because it's about cleaning dirty booths and making others feel compelled to mop. It doesn't use overtly positive words like \"clean,\" \"nice,\" or \"happy.\" Instead, the context is about maintaining cleanliness in a place that might be associated with messiness.\n\nBut wait, is the sentiment negative? Or could it be neutral because it's just stating Tommy's job? The second part of the sentence adds more context. It says after viewing this one, you'll feel like mopping up too. That implies that whatever was viewed made a strong impression, likely negative, because someone would want to clean.\n\nSo putting it together: The overall sentiment is about a dirty or unpleasant environment that requires cleaning, which isn't positive. However, it's not extremely negative either\u2014there's no explicit anger or sadness. It's more of a neutral-negative tone, pointing out the need for cleaning due to an unclean situation. So maybe it's leaning towards 1 (negative) because it's highlighting something that needs fixing, but it's not overly emotional.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about whether \"mopping up\" is seen as a necessary task rather than negative, perhaps it's neutral. But the way it's phrased makes me think the situation is unpleasant enough to warrant cleaning, which suggests negativity. So maybe 1 (negative) is the right classification.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative because it highlights an unpleasant and dirty environment that requires cleaning, implying a less than favorable situation.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 55.454377646994544], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase starts with \"not to mention,\" which is a way of adding something extra. It's often used to emphasize another point after an initial statement. Then there's \"absolutely refreshed.\" Refreshed generally means feeling renewed or revitalized, which is a positive emotion.\n\nPutting it together: The speaker is saying that in addition to whatever else they might have mentioned, they are absolutely refreshed. That sounds positive because being refreshed is a good state. So the sentiment here should be on the positive side.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. \"Not to mention\" doesn't carry a negative connotation; it's more about adding information. The key word is \"refreshed,\" which is definitely positive. Since they used \"absolutely\" as an intensifier, that makes the sentiment even stronger.\n\nSo considering all this, I think the sentiment is positive. On the scale from 0 to 4, where 4 is very positive, this should be a 3 or maybe even a 4. But since it's just \"refreshed,\" not superlatives like \"incredible\" or \"amazing,\" maybe 3 is more appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is positive. The word \"refreshed\" indicates a favorable feeling, and while \"absolutely\" intensifies it, it doesn't reach the level of very positive.

Let's start by reading the text carefully.\n\nThe text says: \"the french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused, excruciatingly tedious cinema that, half an hour in, starts making water torture seem appealing.\"\n\nAlright, breaking this down. The first part mentions a French director who made a movie that's almost 2 and a half hours long. But the adjectives used are \"unfocused\" and \"excruciatingly tedious.\" Both of these words have negative connotations. \"Unfocused\" suggests that the film lacks direction or clarity, which is not a positive trait. \"Excruciatingly tedious\" means it's extremely boring or tiresome.\n\nThen it goes on to say that after just half an hour, the movie makes water torture seem appealing. Water torture is known to be a painful and unpleasant experience, so saying that even that seems good in comparison implies that the film is so bad or unbearable that someone would prefer something else, no matter how unpleasant.\n\nSo putting this all together, the sentiment expressed here is definitely negative. The person is criticizing the director's work as being long, unfocused, tedious, and so boring that it makes a painful experience seem better. That\u2019s a strong negative statement.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The text uses strong negative words like \"excruciatingly\" and compares the film to something as unpleasant as water torture being appealing. That's pretty harsh, so it should be on the lower end of the scale.\n\nI think this would fall under 0 (very negative) because the criticism is severe and the language used is quite strong.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses strongly negative adjectives like \"excruciatingly tedious\" and compares the film unfavorably to water torture, indicating a very negative sentiment.\n\nAnswer: 0", 0, 0, 42.949061480001546], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It seems like someone is telling others not to dislike a movie or work titled \"El Crimen del Padre Amaro\" because of its anti-Catholic stance. So they're advising against hating it based on that reason.\n\nNow, thinking about sentiment here. The main verb is \"don't hate,\" which implies the speaker doesn't want people to have a negative opinion of this work. By suggesting not to hate it due to being anti-Catholic, the speaker might be neutralizing any potential negativity or perhaps even supporting the work despite its content.\n\nThe phrase could be interpreted as encouraging an open mind rather than jumping to dislike something just because of its subject matter. So maybe the sentiment isn't negative; instead, it's trying to counteract a possible negative view by advising against hating it based on that factor.\n\nIs there any positive spin here? The speaker is urging people not to judge the work harshly because it's anti-Catholic. They might be implying that despite its content, the work has value or is worth considering without prejudice. That could lean towards a neutral or slightly positive sentiment.\n\nBut I'm also considering if the sentence itself has any inherent positivity. It doesn't explicitly praise the work; it just advises against hating it for a specific reason. So perhaps it's more of a neutral statement, trying to balance perspectives rather than expressing outright positivity or negativity.\n\nAlternatively, could it be slightly positive? If the speaker is defending the work against being hated, that might show some support, which would push it towards 2 (neutral) or maybe even 3 (positive). However, without explicit praise, it's safer to consider it neutral.\n\nPutting it all together: The sentiment doesn't lean strongly negative because it's advising against hating. It's also not overtly positive since there's no clear praise. So I think the most accurate classification here is 2, which is neutral.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence advises against hating a work based on its anti-Catholic stance, suggesting neutrality by urging an open perspective rather than expressing explicit positivity or negativity.\n\n2", 2, 2, 46.29863332098466], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It seems like this is a review or critique of someone's work, possibly in media like a movie, book, or TV show. The subject is \"fulford-wierzbicki,\" which could be an actor or director. \n\nBreaking down the sentence: \"deftly captures\" \u2013 that means they did it skillfully. \"wise-beyond-her-years teen\" suggests the character portrayed is unusually mature for her age, which is a positive trait.\n\nSo, the sentiment here is positive because it's complimenting both the person (fulford-wierzbicki) and the character. It's not extremely effusive, but definitely favorable.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The text isn't just a simple compliment; it's highlighting skill and portraying a positive attribute in the character. However, there's no superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"fantastic,\" so maybe not the highest (4). It seems more moderate but clearly positive.\n\nTherefore, I think the sentiment is 3, which represents a positive score.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence compliments both the individual and the portrayal of a character, indicating a positive sentiment without extreme language. \n\n3", 3, 3, 32.767328451009234], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The word \"nair\" seems like a name, maybe someone's name. The phrase doesn't treat issues lightly suggests that Nair takes things seriously. So, does treating issues seriously have a positive or negative connotation?\n\nWell, if someone doesn't take issues lightly, it often means they are thorough, careful, and responsible in handling problems. This is usually seen as a positive trait because it implies dedication and seriousness. On the other hand, some might think that not taking things lightly could mean being too strict or overbearing, but that's more of an interpretation.\n\nLooking at the structure, there's no negative word here like \"sad\" or \"bad.\" The phrase is more about the approach someone takes rather than expressing emotion directly. So maybe it's leaning towards a positive sentiment because it shows responsibility and attentiveness.\n\nIs there any ambiguity? Could this be neutral? Well, if we don't know the context, it's hard to say definitively, but in most cases, treating issues seriously is viewed positively. \n\nSo considering all that, I think the sentiment here would be positive but not extremely so. So maybe a 3 (positive). It doesn't have any very strong words, just a statement of how someone handles things.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence suggests that Nair takes issues seriously, which is generally seen as a positive trait indicating responsibility and thoroughness.\n\n3", 3, 3, 36.48811044602189], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It's talking about someone looking at a girl wearing tight pants and having \"big tits.\" Then it says that person \"turns stupid.\" Hmm, so I'm trying to understand if this is a compliment or something negative.\n\nThe phrase \"turn stupid\" sounds like it's implying that seeing this girl makes you less intelligent or perhaps causes you to act foolishly. That could be seen as a bit derogatory towards the girl because it's suggesting she has a negative effect on someone's intelligence. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the reaction of the person looking at her, but I think the implication is that the girl's appearance leads to this reaction.\n\nSo, considering the sentiment scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. The statement seems to be making a somewhat derogatory comment about the girl by suggesting she causes someone else to act stupidly. This could be seen as offensive or disrespectful.\n\nHowever, it's possible that the speaker isn't being serious and might be using hyperbole.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe text starts with \"call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie.\" The phrase \"cold-hearted curmudgeon\" is definitely negative, suggesting the speaker is being harsh or unfeeling. They're saying they can't enjoy a mindless action movie, which might indicate disappointment or criticism towards such films.\n\nThen it says, \"but I believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid.\" The word \"insipid\" means lacking interest or flavor, so that's another negative term. However, they're saying that while movies can be mindless, they shouldn't reach the extreme of being completely boring or uninteresting.\n\nPutting it together: The speaker is critical of mindless action movies, calling them insipid and expressing a negative view about enjoying such films. So the overall sentiment seems quite negative. But there's a slight nuance because they're not saying all mindless movies are bad, just that some reach an extreme level of being boring. \n\nBut focusing on the emotions expressed: The use of strong negative language like \"curmudgeon\" and \"insipid\" suggests a clear negative sentiment. However, it's not overly extreme; they're making a specific criticism rather than a completely harsh attack.\n\nSo, considering the options:\n0 - Very negative\n1 - Negative\n2 - Neutral\n3 - Positive\n4 - Very positive\n\nThe text is definitely negative but not extremely so.

Let me break down the text. Words like \"elegantly produced\" and \"expressively performed\" are strong positive adjectives. They describe something being done well and with care. Then, \"crystallize key plot moments into minutely detailed wonders of dreamlike ecstasy.\" The words \"wonders,\" \"dreamlike,\" and \"ecstasy\" all convey a sense of awe and pleasure.\n\nSo each part of the sentence is adding up to a very positive sentiment.

The first part mentions that the opera happens mostly indoors. That's just a factual statement, so neutral. Then the second part says that Jacquot (presumably the director or someone involved) \"seems unsure\" about evoking naturalism on the set. Using words like \"unsure\" and stating that they couldn't achieve naturalism suggests some criticism.\n\nNaturalism in theater often refers to creating a believable, realistic environment. If Jacquot is unsure how to do this, it might mean the production feels artificial or unconvincing. The use of \"seems unsure\" implies doubt about his ability, which isn't positive. So overall, there's a negative sentiment here because it points out a deficiency in the production.\n\nI don't see any positive words; it's more about pointing out a problem.

It starts by describing \"Frida\" as a kind of colorful and dramatized PBS program.PBS programs are typically educational or cultural, so that gives some context. The words \"colorful\" and \"dramatized\" seem to be used in a positive light. Colorful usually implies something vibrant and engaging, while dramatized suggests it's lively or well-acted.\n\nThen the sentence says, \"Frida gets the job done.\" This part is a bit more neutral on its own. It doesn't explicitly state whether getting the job done is good or bad, but in context with the previous words, it might imply that Frida successfully achieves what it set out to do, which could be seen as positive.\n\nPutting it all together: \"colorful\" and \"dramatized\" are positive descriptors, and \"gets the job done\" suggests effectiveness. So overall, the sentiment seems positive but not extremely so. It's more on the light positive side rather than very enthusiastic or glowing. \n\nI should consider if there are any negative words here, but I don't see any. The adjectives used are all favorable. Therefore, the sentiment is likely positive. But it doesn't use superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"excellent,\" so maybe not a 4.

Then it says the play \"only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome.\" Both \"farcical\" and \"loathsome\" are negative terms, with \"farcical\" implying something absurd or ridiculous in a negative way, and \"loathsome\" meaning disgusting or repulsive.\n\nThe phrase \"delicate tightrope\" suggests that the adaptation teetered between two bad extremes without finding any positive ground. So the entire sentence is loaded with negative descriptors.\n\nNow, mapping this to the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, etc. Since all the adjectives used are strongly negative and there's no hint of positivity, it should be either 0 or 1. \"Terrible\" is more intense than just a simple negative, so 0 (very negative) seems appropriate.\n\nI don't think the user is looking for anything beyond this classification. They probably want a quick and accurate sentiment score without any extra details. It's important to ensure that each word's negativity contributes correctly to the overall score.\n</think>\n\n0", 0, 0, 37.47110111301299], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break it down. The user wants a classification from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive.\n\nFirst, looking at the words used. \"Works\" could be neutral, but combined with \"nothing short of a minor miracle,\" that's definitely strong praise. \"Minor miracle\" implies something impressive or unexpected. So Diane Lane's performance is being praised here.\n\nThe structure of the sentence suggests admiration for her acting. The phrase \"nothing short of\" is used to emphasize how impressive her work was. It's not just good; it's almost miraculous, which is a very positive sentiment.\n\nI don't see any negative words or context here. It's all about commendation. So, this should be on the higher end of positivity. \n\nComparing to the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. Since it's using strong positive language like \"miracle,\" I think 4 makes sense here because it's not just positive but extremely so.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is very positive due to the use of highly complimentary language.\n\n4", 4, 4, 27.382204617984826], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me start by reading the text carefully.\n\nThe sentence is: \"an enjoyable comedy of lingual and cultural differences ... the ch\u00e2teau is a film -- full of life and small delights -- that has all the wiggling energy of young kitten.\"\n\nHmm, breaking it down. The first part says it's an \"enjoyable comedy,\" which immediately suggests positivity because \"enjoyable\" is a positive adjective. Then it mentions \"lingual and cultural differences,\" but in context, this seems to be highlighting the subject matter without any negative connotation.\n\nNext, it refers to \"the ch\u00e2teau as a film.\" The descriptors here are \"full of life\" and \"small delights,\" both of which are clearly positive phrases. \"Full of life\" implies vibrancy and energy, while \"small delights\" suggests pleasant surprises or enjoyable moments.\n\nThe last part is interesting: \"that has all the wiggling energy of young kitten.\" Using a metaphor comparing the film's energy to that of a young kitten adds a playful and lively feel. Kittens are often associated with joy and playfulness, so this reinforces the positive sentiment.\n\nPutting it all together, every adjective and descriptor used is positive. There's nothing negative mentioned here. The words \"enjoyable,\" \"full of life,\" \"small delights,\" and the comparison to a young kitten all contribute to an upbeat and favorable view of the film.\n\nI should also consider if there are any hidden negatives, but I don't see any. Sometimes texts can have double meanings or sarcasm, but here it seems straightforwardly positive. The ellipses in the middle might just be separating different descriptive parts without indicating any pause or hesitation that would hint at a mixed sentiment.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the sentiment is very positive. On the scale given (0 being very negative up to 4 being very positive), this should be classified as a 4.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses several positive adjectives and metaphors to describe the film, indicating a very positive sentiment.\n\n4", 4, 4, 44.57576564801275], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The word \"stinks\" immediately stands out as a strong negative term. It literally means something smells bad but here it's probably metaphorical, indicating that the whole thing is unpleasant or of low quality from beginning to end. \n\nThen there's \"from start to finish,\" which suggests that this negativity isn't just in parts but throughout the entire experience. So whatever they're talking about\u2014maybe a movie, a book, an event\u2014it's bad all the way through.\n\nThe next part compares it to \"a wet burlap sack of gloom.\" Let me visualize that. A wet burlap sack is probably heavy and not very pleasant, maybe even a bit gross. Adding \"gloom\" to it emphasizes sadness or melancholy. So this metaphor isn't just about something being bad but also bringing down the mood.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment here is clearly negative. The language is strong, with words like \"stinks\" and metaphors that evoke unpleasantness and gloominess. There's no positive spin or any neutral elements. It seems very harsh and critical.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. Since it uses strong negative language and a vivid, grim metaphor, this should be on the lower end of the scale.\n\nIs it 0 (very negative) or 1? Well, \"stinks\" is quite a harsh word, but maybe not the most extreme. However, combined with the rest of the description, it seems to lean towards very negative rather than just negative. So I think 0 makes sense here.\n</think>\n\n0", 0, 1, 39.37103216198739], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The director is mentioned, so this is likely a review of a movie or some kind of film adaptation. The phrase \"plays it straight\" could mean that the director didn't add any twist or took a straightforward approach. Maybe they stuck to the original story without adding anything new.\n\nThen it says \"turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder.\" Here, \"listless\" is an adjective I recognize as meaning lacking energy or enthusiasm. So this part suggests that the adaptation feels lifeless or uninspired. The phrase \"climb down the social ladder\" makes me think of someone losing their social status, but in a negative way\u2014maybe showing a decline without any positive aspects.\n\nPutting it together: The director took a straightforward approach to leys' fable, resulting in a film that's described as listless and dealing with a descent down the social ladder. This seems like a critique. \"Listless\" is definitely a negative word here\u2014it conveys boredom or lack of interest. So the sentiment isn't just neutral; it's leaning towards negative.\n\nIs there any positive aspect? The text doesn't mention anything good about the adaptation, so I don't think it's neutral. It's pointing out that the director didn't add much and the result is a lackluster film.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, etc. Since \"listless\" is quite strong in its negativity, but not extremely harsh, I think it falls into the negative category rather than very negative. So that would be 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to the use of words like \"listless,\" which conveys a lack of energy and enthusiasm.

The user provided a sentence: \"As earnest as a community-college advertisement, American Chai is enough to make you put away the guitar, sell the amp, and apply to medical school.\" They want me to assign it a score from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. The first part compares something called \"American Chai\" to a community-college advertisement, which is described as \"earnest.\" Earnest usually means sincere or serious, so that's somewhat neutral but leaning towards positive because it implies dedication.\n\nNext, the sentence says that American Chai is enough to make someone take certain actions: put away the guitar, sell the amp, and apply to medical school. These actions seem significant. Putting away a guitar and selling an amp suggests stopping something enjoyable or a hobby, which might be seen as negative because it implies giving up on music. However, applying to medical school is a serious and often positive step towards a career.\n\nPutting these together, the overall sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative. The comparison to an advertisement is neutral-positive, but the actions suggested are a mix of giving up something (maybe enjoyable) for a more serious path. It doesn't express strong positivity or negativity; it's more about making a change that's significant but not inherently good or bad.\n\nSo, considering all this, the sentiment is probably neutral. Therefore, I should classify it as 2.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence compares \"American Chai\" to an earnest community-college advertisement and suggests significant life changes.

That could imply a negative sentiment because if parents can predict everything, maybe the story isn't engaging or original enough for them. \n\nThen it mentions there isn't enough clever innuendo to fill something. The word \"innuendo\" here suggests that maybe the content is trying to be subtle or has underlying messages. If there's not enough of this, perhaps the text feels lacking in depth or subtlety, which might make parents feel underwhelmed.\n\nPutting it together, the sentiment seems negative because both points highlight shortcomings from the parent's perspective\u2014predictability and lack of cleverness.

Let me read it again: \"though it's equally solipsistic in tone, the movie has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of evans' saga of hollywood excess.\" Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence. The first part says the movie is \"equally solipsistic,\" which means self-absorbed or self-obsessed. That sounds a bit negative, but maybe not too harsh. Then it continues by saying the movie has \"enough vitality\" to justify making a screen adaptation. Vitality suggests energy and life, which are positive traits.\n\nSo there's a mix here: one part is slightly negative, the other is positive. The overall sentiment seems to lean towards approval because despite the solipsistic tone, the vitality justifies the adaptation. So I'm thinking it's more on the positive side but not extremely so. Neutral would be 2, but since there's a justification for creating an adaptation, that's a positive note.\n\nI should probably go with a 3 here because it's positive but not overly enthusiastic.

The phrase is \"mordantly funny and intimately knowing\". Hmm, let's break it down word by word.\n\nFirst, \"mordantly funny\" \u2013 mordant usually means something that's biting or sarcastic in a humorous way. So this suggests humor but maybe with an edge, not just light-hearted jokes. It could be darkly funny or satirical. But overall, funny is positive, so even though it has an edge, the main sentiment here seems positive.\n\nNext, \"intimately knowing\" \u2013 this phrase gives me a sense of something that's very perceptive or insightful. It feels like the speaker is acknowledging something deeply personal or well-understood. This can be seen as complimentary because it implies understanding and empathy, which are positive traits.\n\nPutting them together, both parts of the sentence have positive connotations. \"Mordantly funny\" adds a layer of sharp humor, but it's still within the realm of positivity. The second part enhances that by adding depth to the knowing aspect, making the overall sentiment feel positive but maybe a bit sophisticated or nuanced.\n\nSince I need to classify this on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive), and considering both parts lean towards positive without any strongly negative words, I think it should be either a 3 or 4. But since \"mordant\" could imply some biting humor that might not be universally liked, maybe it's slightly less than very positive. So, perhaps a 3 for positive.\n\nWait, but sometimes people find dark humor very funny and appreciate the depth of understanding. Maybe it's more towards the higher end. I'm a bit torn between 3 and 4. On one hand, it's definitely positive; on the other, \"mordant\" might make some people uncomfortable, but overall, the sentiment is still positive.\n\nI think I'll go with 3 because while it's positive, there's that edge to the humor which might not make everyone feel extremely positive. So, 3 seems appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe phrase combines dark humor (\"mordantly funny\") and deep understanding (\"intimately knowing\"), both of which are positive but nuanced.

The text given is: \"unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the words used. The term \"unspools\" usually refers to unraveling or unfolding something, often in a negative context, but it can just mean revealing a story. Here, it's being used to describe how something is presented.\n\nNext, \"highbrow\" suggests that it's intellectual or meant for an educated audience. That doesn't have a clear positive or negative connotation on its own; it's more descriptive. Then, \"low-key\" implies subtlety or restraint, which again isn't inherently good or bad\u2014it depends on the context.\n\nThe text calls it a 102-minute infomercial. Infomercials are typically meant to sell products or services and can sometimes be seen as persuasive rather than purely informative. This could lean slightly negative if the intention is to criticize it for being overly salesy, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe phrase \"blending entrepreneurial zeal\" uses \"zeal,\" which is positive\u2014it conveys passion and enthusiasm. Then, it mentions \"the testimony of satisfied customers,\" which is definitely a positive element because customer satisfaction is a good sign.\n\nPutting this together: the text describes something that presents information in an intellectual, subtle way, as a long infomercial that combines entrepreneurial passion with customer testimonials. While there's a neutral or slightly positive aspect from the satisfied customers and entrepreneurial zeal, the mention of it being an infomercial might imply some criticism, suggesting it's more about selling than providing balanced information.\n\nHowever, without stronger negative words like \"boring,\" \"manipulative,\" or \"disappointing,\" I don't think the sentiment is very negative. It seems more on the positive side because the focus is on satisfied customers and entrepreneurial passion, which are positive elements. The infomercial aspect might be neutralizing it a bit, but overall, the positives seem to outweigh any potential negatives.\n\nSo, considering all this, I would classify the sentiment as 3 (positive). It's not extremely positive with superlatives like \"excellent\" or \"wonderful,\" so it doesn't reach a 4. But it's clearly more on the positive side than neutral or negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text describes an infomercial that combines entrepreneurial passion and customer satisfaction, leaning towards a positive sentiment without strong negatives.\n\n3", 3, 2, 56.613118487002794], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It's talking about Romanek's themes and visuals. The phrase \"every bit as distinctive\" seems to be a compliment because it suggests that both his themes and visuals are unique or stand out in a good way. \n\nThe word \"distinctive\" usually has a positive connotation because it means something is notable or memorable, which is generally seen as a good quality. So the sentence is saying that Romanek's themes match his visuals in being distinctive, implying both are commendable.\n\nThere's no negative language here\u2014no words like bad, poor, or unfortunate. It's more about highlighting positive attributes. The structure of the sentence also supports this; it's comparing two aspects (themes and visuals) positively without any contrasting elements.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment is positive but not extremely so. It's a straightforward compliment without hyperbole, so I think it falls into category 3 for positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text highlights that Romanek's themes are distinctive like his visuals, which is a positive statement. \n\n3", 3, 4, 25.41919794701971], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It seems like it's describing a situation in a movie where every time someone thinks they've reached the conclusion, there's another scene that also looks like an ending. Hmm, so this could be either a positive or negative observation depending on context.\n\nOn one hand, if a movie keeps surprising you with multiple endings, some people might find that exciting and clever. It could mean the story is intricate or has twists that keep viewers engaged until the very end. In that case, it's positive because it shows complexity and depth in the storytelling.\n\nBut on the other hand, this description might imply confusion. If the movie keeps jumping to different endings without a clear conclusion, some viewers might find it frustrating or unsatisfying. They expected one ending but kept getting more, which could leave them feeling confused rather than impressed. That would lean towards a negative sentiment because it's about not meeting expectations.\n\nI need to determine which interpretation is more likely. The sentence doesn't explicitly state whether the multiple endings are good or bad; it just describes the situation. So without additional context, it's neutral. It's neither clearly positive nor negative but rather factual in nature.\n\nTherefore, considering that it's a description without explicit sentiment, the sentiment score should be 2, which is neutral.\n</think>\n\nThe text neutrally describes a movie structure with multiple endings, without expressing clear positivity or negativity.\n\n2", 2, 1, 33.48982274599257], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The use of \"infiltrated\" suggests a negative influence, maybe unwanted or pervasive. \n\nThe phrase \"not always for the better\" directly indicates that there's a downside to this infiltration. So overall, the sentiment is negative because it's pointing out that show business isn't just influencing but doing so in ways that aren't positive.\n\nI should consider if any parts are neutral or positive.

They're being accused of making things more complicated by ignoring logic and science, which likely leads to a less enjoyable or believable storyline. \n\nSo, considering the negative language and the criticism towards the approach taken by the writers, I'd say this sentiment is negative.

Steve Martin is a well-known comedian and actor, so saying that Schneider isn't him might be pointing out that Schneider doesn't have the same skills or presence as Steve Martin. This could be negative towards Schneider if it's implying he's not as good.\n\nPutting it together: The first part seems neutral or maybe positive depending on context, but the second part is clearly a comparison where Schneider is being unfavorably compared to Steve Martin. So overall, there might be a slightly negative sentiment because of that comparison.\n\nBut I need to make sure if \"strictly speaking\" softens that statement or not. It could mean they're just stating an objective fact without much emotion. Maybe it's more neutral than outright negative. Also, the first part doesn't have any clear positive or negative words; it's more descriptive.\n\nSo maybe the sentiment is slightly negative but not very strong. That would be a 1 on the scale.\n</think>\n\nThe text compares Schneider unfavorably to Steve Martin, indicating a negative sentiment, though the comparison is stated neutrally. The overall sentiment leans negative but isn't strongly so.\n\n1", 1, 0, 44.042445156985195], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Then the second part says, \"but it wasn't horrible either.\" So they're comparing it to being horrible and saying it's not that bad.\n\nSo putting those together: the movie isn't good, but it's also not terrible. That seems like a neutral sentiment because it's balanced between negative and positive. The person didn't hate it enough to call it horrible, nor did they enjoy it enough to consider it good. \n\nI should make sure I'm not overcomplicating this.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll look for keywords that indicate positive or negative sentiment. The words \"quirky\" and \"charms\" stand out as positive terms. They suggest that the actors' performances are engaging and have a certain appeal. \"Recessive\" might mean something like understated or subtle, which can be seen as a good thing in acting because it shows depth without being over-the-top.\n\nNext, there's mention of a \"problematic script.\" That definitely sounds negative. It implies that the script has issues, maybe with dialogue, pacing, plot, etc., which could detract from the overall quality of whatever they're talking about (likely a movie or TV show).\n\nSo putting it together: The text acknowledges both positive and negative aspects. The positive comes from the actors' performances, while the negative is about the script. However, the phrase \"help overcome\" suggests that despite the problematic script, the actors manage to salvage the situation to some extent.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment scale:\n0 - Very Negative\n1 - Negative\n2 - Neutral\n3 - Positive\n4 - Very Positive\n\nThe text isn't entirely positive because it points out a flaw in the script. But it's also not entirely negative because it highlights the actors' strengths that mitigate the issue. So it's somewhat balanced but leans more towards positive since overcoming a problem is seen as a good outcome.\n\nI think this would be classified as 3 (positive) because while there's a negative element, the overall message is that the positives manage to outweigh the negatives.\n</think>\n\nThe text mentions both positive aspects of the actors' performances and a negative aspect regarding the script.

So together, these words paint a picture of a film that's energetic and visually appealing, which would make someone feel positive about it.\n\nConsidering the scale, 0 to 4 with 2 as neutral, I think this sentiment leans more towards positive than neutral because of the use of \"bright\" and \"flashy\" in a complimentary way. However, it might not be extremely positive (which would be 4) since the language isn't overly effusive or superlative.\n\nSo, after evaluating each word and the overall tone, I believe the sentiment is positive but not extremely so.

The input here is \"it 's sweet .\" and I need to figure out which number it falls under.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each sentiment score represents. Let me list them again: \n\n0 - very negative\n\n1 - negative\n\n2 - neutral\n\n3 - positive\n\n4 - very positive\n\nNow, looking at the text: \"it 's sweet .\" The word \"sweet\" is a key here. In English, when someone describes something as sweet, it usually has a positive connotation. For example, saying a dessert is sweet is a compliment. But wait, sometimes \"sweet\" can be used neutrally too, especially if the context isn't clear. Like in some technical contexts or descriptions.\n\nIn this case, though, there's not much else to go on. The sentence is short and simple: it just says something is sweet. Without more context, I might default towards a neutral sentiment because \"sweet\" can sometimes be seen as a factual description rather than an opinion. But considering common usage, \"sweet\" often conveys a positive feeling.\n\nI should think about how people use the word in everyday language. If someone says, \"It's sweet,\" they're likely expressing that something is pleasant or agreeable. For example, if a child draws a picture and you say, \"That's sweet,\" you mean it's nice or heartwarming.\n\nAlternatively, if someone is talking about a taste, like food being sweet, it can be neutral in some contexts but generally has a positive implication because sweetness is often enjoyable.\n\nSo considering all that, the sentiment here is leaning towards positive. But how strong is that positivity? The options are 3 (positive) or maybe even 4 (very positive). However, \"sweet\" isn't extremely strong; it's more of a mild compliment. So I think 3 might be appropriate because it conveys a positive sentiment without being overly enthusiastic.\n\nWait, but could there be any negative implications? In some cases, \"sweet\" can be used sarcastically to mean something is overly sentimental or cloying, but that would usually require context. Since the text doesn't provide any such cues, I shouldn't assume sarcasm unless it's clearly indicated.\n\nTherefore, sticking with positive without going into very positive because \"sweet\" isn't an extremely strong word in this context. So I think 3 is the right classification here.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed by the text is positive but not extremely so. \n\n3", 3, 3, 54.7168143579911], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text provided is: \"bittersweet comedy/drama full of life, hand gestures, and some really adorable Italian guys.\" I need to classify its sentiment as 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), or 4 (very positive).\n\nFirst, I'll break down the text to understand each component. The genres mentioned are comedy and drama, which combined can often result in a bittersweet tone. Bittersweet usually implies a mix of happiness and sadness, so it's not purely negative or positive.\n\nNext, looking at the descriptors: \"full of life\" suggests energy and positivity. This phrase is generally positive as it conveys vibrancy and vitality. Then there are \"hand gestures,\" which can be indicative of expressive communication. Depending on context, this could add to a lively or engaging atmosphere, leaning towards positive.\n\nLastly, the mention of \"adorable Italian guys\" clearly has a positive connotation. Adorable is a term that expresses affection and charm, so this part contributes positively to the sentiment.\n\nNow, considering the combination: bittersweet can sometimes make things less overtly positive because it involves both happy and sad elements. However, in this context, the other descriptors (\"full of life,\" \"hand gestures,\" \"adorable\") seem to lean more towards the positive side. The overall impression is that while there's a mix, the predominant feelings are positive.\n\nI should also think about the balance between the bittersweet aspect and the other elements. Since \"bittersweet\" isn't overpowering but rather sets a tone, and the rest of the descriptors are clearly positive, it doesn't tip the sentiment into negative territory. Instead, it combines to create an overall positive yet nuanced feel.\n\nI might consider whether any part could be neutral or have a negative slant, but \"full of life\" and \"adorable\" don't leave room for neutrality; they're distinctly positive. The presence of both comedy and drama typically leads to varied emotions, but without specific negative keywords, it's safe to lean towards the positives mentioned.\n\nSo, putting it all together: bittersweet as a modifier that doesn't negate the positivity from other elements. Therefore, the sentiment is positive enough to warrant a score higher than neutral but not extremely positive.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 4, 49.4722033230064], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text provided is \"a serious movie with serious ideas.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what sentiment analysis entails. Sentiment analysis is about determining the overall mood or emotion of a piece of text. In this case, it's quite short\u2014only two phrases\u2014but that shouldn't be too hard. The key here is to figure out if the words used convey positive, negative, or neutral feelings.\n\nLooking at the text: \"a serious movie with serious ideas.\" Both \"serious\" and \"movie\" as well as \"ideas\" are the main components here. Now, \"serious\" can have different connotations depending on context. In some cases, it might imply something is intense, weighty, or perhaps even a bit somber. However, in other contexts, especially when talking about movies, saying a movie is serious can be a compliment because it suggests depth and thoughtfulness.\n\nSo, \"serious\" doesn't inherently have a positive or negative connotation on its own\u2014it's more of a neutral descriptor. But when combined with \"movie\" and \"ideas,\" it might lean towards something positive. Let me think about how people use such phrases. When someone describes a movie as serious with serious ideas, they're often highlighting that the film has substance, tackles important themes, or presents complex concepts. That usually isn't a negative assessment; in fact, it's often used positively because it suggests intelligence and depth.\n\nI should also consider the overall structure of the sentence. It doesn't include any explicitly positive words like \"wonderful,\" \"amazing,\" or \"brilliant.\" Neither does it use negative terms such as \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" So, on one hand, there's no overt positivity or negativity in the wording. On the other hand, describing a movie as having serious ideas might imply that the speaker thinks highly of its content, which could be a positive sentiment.\n\nAnother angle is to think about the absence of emotional language. There are no adjectives that carry strong feelings\u2014just \"serious\" twice and then \"movie\" and \"ideas.\" Without any modifiers like \"deeply moving\" or \"boring,\" it's tricky but I have to infer based on context. In film reviews, when someone mentions a movie being serious with serious ideas, they're often indicating appreciation for its intellectual or thematic depth.\n\nSo putting this all together: the phrase doesn't express overt positivity or negativity, which might make me lean towards neutral (2). However, considering that \"serious\" in this context is likely used to praise the film's depth and thoughtfulness, it could carry a slightly positive connotation. But since there are no explicitly positive words, maybe it's still on the lower end of positive rather than very positive.\n\nWait, but I also shouldn't assume too much positivity without evidence. The sentence is more about description than emotion. It's factual in nature\u2014stating that the movie is serious and has serious ideas. Without any emotional qualifiers, perhaps the sentiment is neutral. But then again, sometimes descriptions can carry subtextual sentiments.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating it a bit. Let me recall some examples: if someone says \"The lecture was informative,\" that's positive. If they say \"The lecture was long,\" that's neutral unless context implies negativity. Here, saying the movie is serious with serious ideas is more about content than emotion. However, in many contexts, emphasizing seriousness can imply approval, especially when discussing movies or books.\n\nSo maybe it's a 3 (positive) because the emphasis on depth and seriousness suggests a favorable view without explicitly using positive language. Alternatively, if \"serious\" was used to criticize the movie for being too solemn or lacking entertainment value, that would be negative. But in this case, I think the implication is more about quality than criticism.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's no explicit positivity, the descriptors imply a respectful and appreciative tone towards the film's content, which leans it towards positive sentiment. Therefore, I'll classify this as 3 (positive).\n</think>\n\nThe text describes a movie with depth and intellectual substance, implying a favorable view without overtly positive language.\n\n3", 3, 4, 89.62540030499804], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The main components are \"film,\" \"pretty good overall picture,\" and \"situation in Laramie following the murder.\" \n\nThe phrase \"pretty good\" stands out to me as positive. It's not extremely enthusiastic, but it's definitely a positive adjective. So that suggests a positive sentiment.\n\nLooking at the rest of the sentence: \"does give a pretty good overall picture.\" The word \"give\" is neutral on its own, but combined with \"pretty good,\" it leans positive. \n\nThe context mentions a film depicting a serious event\u2014the murder of Matthew Shepard. While the topic itself is tragic and could evoke negative feelings, the sentiment here isn't about the event itself but about how well the film portrays it. So the focus is on the quality of the film's depiction rather than the event's negativity.\n\nI don't see any words that indicate a neutral or negative sentiment. Words like \"pretty good\" are definitely positive indicators. There's no sarcasm or hidden meaning that I can detect here, so I think it's safe to take the statement at face value.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. \"Pretty good\" is a moderate positive expression, so it would fall into category 3. It's not extremely positive (which would be 4), but definitely more than just a slight positivity.\n\nI don't think the mention of the murder affects the sentiment classification here because the statement isn't about the event itself but how well the film covers it.

All these descriptors are quite harsh and point towards a very negative opinion. \n\nI should also consider if there's any neutral or positive aspect here, but each term seems critical without any redeeming qualities mentioned.

The text starts by talking about Nicole Holofcenter, calling her an \"insightful writer/director\" and mentioning that she's responsible for an \"illuminating comedy.\" Those are definitely positive adjectives\u2014words like insightful and illuminating usually carry a favorable connotation. So right off the bat, there's some positivity here.\n\nThen it says she doesn't \"wrap the proceedings up neatly.\" Hmm, this part could be tricky. On one hand, not wrapping things up neatly might suggest that the story isn't tied up in a traditional or expected way, which can sometimes be seen as a negative because audiences often like closure. But on the other hand, it's followed by saying that \"the ideas tie together beautifully.\" That phrase is clearly positive\u2014it suggests coherence and a satisfying conclusion despite not being neatly wrapped.\n\nPutting it all together: The text praises Nicole for her insightful and illuminating work but acknowledges that she doesn't follow traditional storytelling structures. However, it quickly follows up by commending how the ideas still come together well. So even though there's a slight criticism about wrapping things up neatly, the overall tone is positive because the praise outweighs any potential negatives.\n\nI think the sentiment here leans more towards positive than neutral or negative. It's not extremely glowing with superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"brilliant,\" but it's definitely favorable. The use of words like \"beautifully\" adds to that positive feeling without going overboard. So, I'd say this is a 3 on the scale\u2014positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text praises Nicole Holofcenter for her insightful and illuminating work in directing an comedy, noting that while the story isn't neatly wrapped up, the ideas tie together beautifully.

The text given is: \"this is a shrewd and effective film from a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood.\"\n\nFirst, I should analyze the words used here. The adjectives are \"shrewd\" and \"effective.\" Shrewd means intelligent, clever, or astute in a way that's practical. Effective means producing a desired result or outcome. Both of these terms are positive.\n\nThe sentence structure is also important. It starts with \"this is a shrewd and effective film,\" which immediately sets a positive tone about the film. Then it adds more praise by talking about the director's ability to create and sustain a mood, which implies that the film successfully conveys an atmosphere or emotion, something viewers often appreciate.\n\nI don't see any negative words here.

The phrase \"cut through the sugar coating\" suggests that Stuart's overly positive or sweet approach isn't enough, and he needs something more harsh or realistic.\n\nPutting it together, Stuart seems to be portrayed as someone who is too optimistic or maybe naive (\"sugar coating\"), and he needs Snowball's cynicism to balance that. This could mean that Stuart's personality is being criticized for being too one-sided\u2014maybe overly positive in a way that's not effective without some realism.\n\nThe overall tone here isn't extremely negative, but it does point out a flaw or a need for improvement in Stuart's character. The mention of needing cynicism suggests that Stuart's approach isn't sufficient on its own and might be seen as naive or ineffective without the counterbalance.\n\nSo considering the options: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. I think this leans more towards negative because it's pointing out a weakness in Stuart's persona. But since it's not overly harsh and just states that he needs something else to balance him, maybe it's a mild negative or possibly neutral.\n\nWait, is it negative? The text isn't necessarily saying Stuart is bad, but rather that his approach alone isn't enough without someone like Snowball. So perhaps the sentiment is slightly negative because it highlights a deficiency in Stuart's character.\n\nAlternatively, could it be neutral if it's just describing a situation without strong emotion? But I think the implication is that Stuart's persona is lacking something, which leans towards a mild criticism. Therefore, I might classify this as 1 (negative) rather than 0 because it's not extremely harsh.\n</think>\n\nThe text suggests that Stuart's overly optimistic approach needs balancing with cynicism, indicating a mild criticism of his character. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 2, 53.73774072001106], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user has provided a text snippet and wants me to classify the sentiment on a scale from 0 to 4. So, first off, I should read through the text carefully.\n\nThe sentence is: \"mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt .\" Okay, breaking it down. Mana is creating these characters that are both compelling and damaged. That's interesting because being damaged usually has a negative connotation, but they're also described as compelling, which might lean positive.\n\nNow, looking at the second part: \"who we want to help -- or hurt.\" This is a bit ambiguous. On one hand, wanting to help suggests empathy and care, which are positive emotions. But the alternative, wanting to hurt them, adds a negative layer. So there's a mix of both here.\n\nI need to figure out if the overall sentiment leans more towards positive or negative. The fact that the characters are compelling might mean that despite their damaged nature, they're engaging and draw the audience in. This could make the sentiment slightly positive because the focus is on the depth of the characters rather than just their flaws.\n\nAlso, the structure of the sentence uses \"compelling\" first, which is a strong adjective, and then qualifies it with \"damaged.\" The second part offers two contrasting actions: help or hurt. But since both are possible reactions, it's not overwhelmingly negative. It suggests complexity in the characters rather than pure negativity.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the sentiment is more on the positive side because it highlights the depth and impact of the characters created by mana. So, giving it a 3 for positive seems appropriate.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 2, 33.71220444299979], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user has provided a specific sentence: \"it is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film .\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. The main points are that it's difficult to care about the character and that this is considered the central flaw of the film. The words used here are quite strong\u2014words like \"very difficult\" and \"central flaw.\" These phrases indicate a significant issue with the film.\n\nThe sentiment seems negative because the person is pointing out a major problem with the movie, specifically regarding the characters which are usually crucial for audience engagement. Since it's hard to care about them, this affects the overall viewing experience negatively.\n\nI should consider how strong these sentiments are. \"Very difficult\" suggests more than just a minor inconvenience\u2014it\u2019s a significant barrier to emotional investment. \"Central flaw\" implies that this is not just one of many issues but perhaps the main problem, which further emphasizes the negativity.\n\nNow, looking at the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, and so on up to 4 as very positive. The sentiment here isn't extremely harsh; it's clearly pointing out a flaw without using overly aggressive language. It's more than just a slight criticism but not the most scathing review.\n\nSo, I think this would fall into category 0 (very negative) because of the strong wording and the mention of a central flaw, which indicates a significant issue with the film.\n</think>\n\n0", 0, 0, 35.276175886014244], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The subject here is \"they,\" which I assume refers to something like actors, a play, or maybe the overall experience. The phrase \"makes it worth the trip\" suggests that whatever \"they\" are, they provide enough value to justify going to the theatre. That sounds positive because saying something is worth the effort usually indicates satisfaction.\n\nI should consider the context. Theatre trips can be time-consuming and sometimes expensive, so someone saying it's worth the trip implies a positive experience. The use of \"make it worth\" also emphasizes that without them, the trip wouldn't have been as valuable, highlighting their importance positively.\n\nAre there any negative words or undertones? I don't see any; the sentiment seems clearly positive. It doesn't express neutrality because it's not just stating a fact\u2014it's expressing satisfaction. It's definitely not negative either since there are no complaints or criticisms mentioned.\n\nSo putting it all together, this sentence is expressing a positive sentiment. Now, deciding between 3 (positive) and 4 (very positive). The phrase \"makes it worth\" feels moderately positive but not extremely so. So I think it falls under 3.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence expresses satisfaction with the experience at the theatre, indicating that \"they\" made the trip worthwhile.

It mentions both \"beautiful\" and \"aching sadness.\" \"Beautiful\" is a positive word, suggesting something aesthetically pleasing or emotionally touching in a good way. On the other hand, \"aching sadness\" combines two words: \"aching,\" which implies a deep, perhaps painful emotion, and \"sadness,\" clearly indicating a negative feeling.\n\nSo there's a mix of emotions here. The phrase doesn't lean entirely positive or entirely negative but rather presents both aspects. \"Beautiful\" might make someone think the overall sentiment is positive because it's an adjective often associated with positivity. However, the presence of \"aching sadness\" introduces a more somber note. \n\nI should consider how these words interact. When something is described as beautiful yet sad, it can create a bittersweet or melancholic feeling. This isn't overtly negative but also not purely positive. It's more of a complex emotion that doesn't fit neatly into just one category.\n\nLooking at the options: 0 and 1 are negative, with 0 being very negative. Since there's a positive adjective (\"beautiful\"), it can't be too negative. Neutral (2) might seem possible, but I think the combination leans slightly towards positive because \"beautiful\" is highlighting something appealing despite the sadness.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's neutral because it has both elements. However, since \"beautiful\" is an aesthetic appreciation of the sadness, perhaps the sentiment tilts more towards a positive outlook on the experience, even though it's sad. \n\nSo I'm leaning toward a 3 (positive) because the use of \"beautiful\" elevates the overall sentiment, making it more than just neutral despite the sadness mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe text combines elements of beauty and sadness, resulting in a bittersweet tone that leans towards positive due to the emphasis on beauty.\n\n3", 3, 3, 41.30529082499561], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Then there's \"delightful,\" which is another strong positive word. \"Witty\" suggests humor or cleverness, which is good. The movie is called a romantic comedy, which is generally seen as a positive genre. \"Zippy jazzy score\" \u2013 zippy means lively and upbeat, so that adds to the positive vibe.\n\nNow, looking at the actors: Grant and Bullock are mentioned, and it says they make it look like they're having fun. This implies their performance is enjoyable and adds to the positive sentiment.\n\nAre there any negative words? I don't see any here. All the adjectives used are positive or neutral, but leaning towards positive.\n\nThe structure of the sentences uses very positive language without any doubt or criticism. So it's clearly a positive review. Since 4 represents very positive, and this text seems to be on the higher end with multiple strong positive descriptors, I think the sentiment should be classified as 4.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 4, 28.56107640999835], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence is: \"Malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain.\" \n\nFirst, I notice the word \"gift\" which usually has a positive connotation. But it's paired with \"nightmarish images,\" which are clearly negative because nightmares are unsettling and scary. The phrase \"hard to burn out of your brain\" suggests that these images leave a strong, lingering impression, possibly in a bad way.\n\nSo there's a mix here: on one hand, Malone is praised for having a gift, but the effect of his work is described as nightmarish. It's not outright positive because the result isn't pleasant. The lingering aspect could make it more intense but not necessarily positive.\n\nI think the sentiment leans negative because the emphasis is on the unsettling and hard-to-forget images rather than just appreciating the skill. But it's not extremely negative since there's still a compliment about Malone's ability. Maybe this would be a 1, which is negative.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence acknowledges Malone's talent but describes the effect as nightmarish and lingering, indicating an overall negative sentiment.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 2, 25.413083562016254], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It says that something is rapidly becoming a gut-wrenching look at how cultural differences and emotional expectations clash. The key words here are \"gut-wrenching\" and \"collide.\" \n\n\"Gut-wrenching\" usually means something that causes intense emotional discomfort or distress. So, that's a pretty strong negative term. When someone describes an experience as gut-wrenching, they're not talking about something pleasant.\n\nThen there's the part about cultural differences and emotional expectations colliding. This could imply conflict or tension between different groups or individuals because of these clashing elements. Conflict often leads to negative emotions like frustration, confusion, or sadness.\n\nPutting it together, the text is describing a situation that brings up intense negative feelings due to these collisions. So, I think this leans towards being negative. But how strong is that negativity?\n\nThe word \"gut-wrenching\" suggests a significant level of emotional impact. It's not just a little bit unpleasant; it's really affecting someone deeply. On the other hand, \"collide\" might be more neutral on its own but in context with the other words, it contributes to the negative sentiment.\n\nSo considering all this, I would say the sentiment is negative. The next step is deciding whether it's just negative (1) or very negative (0). Since \"gut-wrenching\" indicates a strong emotional response, maybe it falls under 0 for very negative. But sometimes gut-wrenching can be seen as a strong emotion but not necessarily the most extreme.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that while the emotions are strong and negative, the sentence doesn't explicitly use words like \"terrible,\" \"horrible,\" or other more strongly negative terms beyond \"gut-wrenching.\" So maybe it's 1 for negative rather than 0. But then again, gut-wrenching is quite a strong term.\n\nI'm a bit torn here between 0 and 1. The sentence doesn't seem overly exaggerated in its negativity beyond the gut-wrenching part. It's more about an examination of collisions, which might not be as extreme as some other contexts where \"gut-wrenching\" could be used.\n\nWait, but the term \"examination\" is neutral, so it's just that this examination brings out these gut-wrenching feelings because of the collision. So perhaps it's more on the negative side without being extremely so. Therefore, maybe 1 for negative.\n\nBut I'm still unsure. Another approach could be to think about similar phrases. If something is gut-wrenching, it's definitely a strong negative emotion, but sometimes in reviews or analyses, that term can be used to highlight the emotional depth rather than just negativity for its own sake. So maybe the sentiment isn't as purely negative as it seems.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that \"gut-wrenching\" is more about the intensity of the experience rather than a straightforward negative emotion, perhaps the overall sentiment could be seen as neutral but with strong feelings. However, in most cases, gut-wrenching refers to something negative.\n\nI think I'll go with 1 because while it's definitely negative, it might not reach the level of very negative.

The text given is:\n\n\"Though excessively tiresome, the uncertainty principle, as verbally pretentious as the title may be, has its handful of redeeming features, as long as you discount its ability to bore.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to understand the sentiment expressed. \n\nThe sentence starts with \"though excessively tiresome,\" which clearly indicates a negative feeling towards something called \"the uncertainty principle.\" Using words like \"excessively\" and \"tiresome\" are strong negative adjectives here.\n\nNext, it mentions that the title is \"verbally pretentious.\" That's another negative point. Pretentious often implies that something is unnecessarily complicated or tries too hard to impress, which can come across as off-putting or unappealing.\n\nHowever, the sentence then takes a turn with \"has its handful of redeeming features.\" The phrase \"redeeming features\" suggests that despite the negatives mentioned earlier, there are positive aspects. So this part is positive. But it's qualified by \"as long as you discount its ability to bore,\" which again brings in another negative aspect\u2014boringness.\n\nSo summarizing the sentiments:\n- Negative: excessively tiresome, verbally pretentious, ability to bore.\n- Positive: handful of redeeming features.\n\nNow, I need to assess how these balance out. The sentence starts with negatives and ends with a positive note but with some caveats. It seems that while there are some good points, they're overshadowed by the negatives because those negatives are explicitly stated as reasons why someone might not like it, even if there are positives.\n\nAlso, considering the structure of the sentence: the negative aspects come first and then the positive is presented in a way that requires discounting another negative. This suggests that the overall sentiment leans more towards the negative side but isn't extremely so because there's an acknowledgment of some positive features.\n\nGiven the scale from 0 to 4, where 2 is neutral, I think this would fall just below neutral into negative territory. So maybe a 1 (negative). But I need to be careful here. The presence of redeeming features might make it not as negative as a pure negative statement without any positives.\n\nAlternatively, since the sentence does mention positive aspects but they're presented in a way that requires ignoring some negatives, perhaps it's more balanced than purely negative. Maybe it leans towards neutral with a slight negative tilt.\n\nWait, another angle: the first part is quite strong in negatives\u2014excessively tiresome and verbally pretentious. The redeeming features are there, but you have to \"discount\" the boring aspect. So maybe the positives aren't enough to tip the sentiment into positive; they just make it not as negative as it could be.\n\nSo perhaps 1 (negative) is appropriate because the overall tone is more critical than positive. The negatives are emphasized with stronger language, while the positives are somewhat downplayed.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a predominantly negative sentiment due to strong negative adjectives and caveats about redeeming features. \n\nOutput: 1", 1, 2, 68.04427441599546], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The person in question is Orson Welles' great-grandson, which adds context about who they're talking about.\n\nNow, thinking about sentiment, this doesn't seem overtly positive or negative at first glance. It's more of a statement expressing an expectation that wasn't met. However, the use of \"should have\" can sometimes carry a slightly negative connotation because it suggests something was missed or could have been done better.\n\nSo, breaking it down: The structure is about an action that should have happened but didn't. This could indicate disappointment or criticism, which would lean towards a negative sentiment. But since it's not strongly worded with harsh adjectives or emotional language, it's not extremely negative either.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment seems to be on the slightly negative side because of the implication that an expectation wasn't met. Therefore, I think the appropriate classification here is 1 (negative).\n</think>\n\nThe sentence expresses a slight negative sentiment due to the unmet expectation implied by \"should have found.\" \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 2, 31.3866449460038], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The term \"eager\" usually has a positive connotation because being eager implies enthusiasm or willingness. But then there's the modifier \"too,\" which can sometimes turn things negative. So when someone is \"too eager to please,\" it might mean they're trying too hard, perhaps in a way that's seen as insincere or overbearing.\n\nThe phrase also mentions \"a bit,\" which softens the statement a little. It suggests that while there's an eagerness to please, it's not overly so\u2014it's just a slight excess. So maybe the sentiment isn't entirely negative but leans towards being slightly negative because of the \"too.\" \n\nI think about how this might be used in context. If someone is described as too eager to please, they might come off as trying too hard to gain approval, which can sometimes be seen as manipulative or not genuine. But since it's just a bit too much, it's not extremely negative.\n\nSo putting it all together: \"a bit too eager to please\" has a slightly negative sentiment because of the \"too,\" but it's not extremely so.

The subject here is \"the transporter,\" which I assume refers to a movie or show, perhaps \"The Transporter\" series known for action sequences.\n\nLooking at the words used: \"bombards\" implies an overwhelming amount of something, in this case, explosions and side snap kicks. These are typical action movie elements\u2014explosions and fight scenes. However, the phrase \"ends up being surprisingly dull\" is crucial here. The word \"dull\" is negative, indicating that despite having these elements, the overall experience was uninteresting or lacking.\n\nThe use of \"surprisingly\" adds context\u2014it wasn't expected to be dull given the action-packed content. But the sentiment leans towards disappointment because the movie didn't deliver as anticipated. \n\nNow, considering the intensity: \"dull\" is a negative term but not extremely harsh.

The word \"immensely\" is a strong adverb meaning very much. It's used here to emphasize how entertaining something is.

Combining this with \"immensely,\" the sentiment becomes quite strong on the positive side.\n\nThen, looking at \"unsung heroes.\" This phrase usually refers to people who haven't received enough recognition but deserve it.

So maybe it's a solid positive but not the highest possible.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about how each word adds up\u2014both parts being positive\u2014the sentiment is definitely on the higher end of positivity but might not reach the very top level unless there were more exuberant language.\n\nSo putting it all together: The sentence has two positive elements without any negative aspects. Therefore, it's a positive sentiment. Is it just positive or very positive? Since \"potent\" and \"involving\" are strong but not superlatives, I think 3 (positive) is the right classification here.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses positive adjectives like \"potent,\" \"ably,\" and \"involving,\" indicating a favorable sentiment without extreme enthusiasm.\n\nAnswer: 3", 3, 2, 47.25316151799052], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

That suggests something visually appealing and well-designed, which is a positive aspect. So that's a plus for the sentiment.\n\nBut then there's a \"but,\" so I know the tone might shift here. The next part says it has a \"forcefully quirky tone.\" Hmm, \"quirky\" can sometimes be seen as positive because it implies uniqueness or originality. However, adding \"forcefully\" in front of it makes me think that this quirkiness is maybe overdone or not organic. It might feel forced rather than natural.\n\nThen, the text continues: \"that quickly wears out its limited welcome.\" This part definitely sounds negative. \"Wears out\" suggests something that becomes tiresome or loses appeal over time. \"Limited welcome\" implies that even from the start, the acceptance or positive reception wasn't extensive and it didn't last long.\n\nPutting it all together, the text starts with a positive aspect but then critiques another element harshly. The positive is there, but the negative seems more impactful because of the words used to describe the quirky tone as forced and its limited welcome. So overall, the sentiment leans towards negative. It's not extremely negative, just leaning that way because despite the good art direction, the other aspects are problematic.\n\nSo on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, I think it's somewhere in the lower end but not the absolute worst. Maybe a 1 since it has both elements but the negatives seem to dominate.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment of the text leans towards negative due to the critique of the quirky tone being forced and its limited welcome, despite the positive art direction.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 41.390850030002184], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase \"true to its animatronic roots\" suggests that it's being compared to something mechanical, which isn't inherently negative but sets the stage for what comes next. Then, the description continues: \"as stiff, ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus.\" Okay, so here they're using words like \"stiff,\" \"ponderous,\" and \"charmless\" to describe the bears. Those are all negative adjectives\u2014stiff implies lack of flexibility or life, ponderous means heavy and slow, which isn't appealing, and charmless clearly indicates a lack of\u5438\u5f15\u529b.\n\nThen there's the part about not being brought out of hibernation: \"should never have been brought out.\" That's a strong negative statement. It suggests that bringing them back was a mistake and that they shouldn't exist anymore. So combining all these elements, it seems like the sentiment is very negative.\n\nI need to map this to the scale provided. 0 is very negative, so that would fit here because of the harsh criticism and the implication that something went wrong by reviving them. It's not just a slight negative; the language used is quite strong, which points towards the most negative category possible in their system.\n\nI should also consider if there's any positive or neutral aspect I might have missed. The first part mentions \"animatronic roots,\" but that doesn't seem to add positivity. Instead, it's setting up a comparison that leads into criticism. So no, I don't think there's any positivity here; it's all negative.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment is 0\u2014very negative.\n</think>\n\n0", 0, 0, 47.48574831598671], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The word \"winning\" suggests something successful or enjoyable, which is a positive indicator. Then \"comedy\" is generally associated with humor and entertainment, so that's another positive point.\n\nNext, there are \"wry observations,\" which typically means clever or witty remarks. Wry can sometimes be slightly sarcastic, but in this context, it adds depth to the comedy, so I think it's still positive rather than negative.\n\nThe rest of the sentence talks about long-lived friendships and losing track of oneself by pleasing others. While the latter part might seem a bit introspective or even a bit melancholic, the overall tone is more reflective than negative. It seems like the text is highlighting these observations in a way that's thoughtful but not necessarily critical.\n\nPutting it all together: \"winning comedy\" and \"wry observations\" are definitely positive elements.

So maybe it's a typo or formatting issue. It should read \"(a) devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid Holocaust drama.\"\n\nNow, looking at the adjectives used: \"devastatingly powerful\" and \"astonishingly vivid.\" Both of these are strong positive descriptors. \"Powerful\" is definitely positive in this context because it's describing a drama that has a strong impact. The word \"devastatingly\" might seem negative on its own, but when paired with \"powerful,\" it actually intensifies the positive aspect by suggesting that the drama is so impactful that it almost feels overwhelming or deeply moving.\n\nSimilarly, \"astonishingly vivid\" uses two positive words. \"Vivid\" means something is lifelike and intense, which in a drama context is a compliment. So putting it all together, both descriptors are highlighting the strengths of the Holocaust drama, indicating a very positive sentiment.\n\nThe subject here is a Holocaust drama, which is a serious topic, but the adjectives used don't reflect any negativity towards the content itself; instead, they praise how effectively and powerfully the story is portrayed. Therefore, the sentiment isn't negative at all. It's clearly leaning towards being very positive because of the strong positive language used.\n\nSo considering the scale from 0 to 4, where 4 is very positive, this text should be classified as a 4.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 4, 41.46688060302404], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

They mention \"difficult\" movies and those that require the audience to engage more by connecting the dots rather than everything being explained clearly.\n\nThe phrase \"I have no problem with\" suggests a positive attitude or acceptance towards these kinds of films. It's not neutral because it's expressing an opinion; they're stating they don't mind something that others might find challenging.\n\nThey also mention that these movies ask the audience to meet them halfway, implying engagement and active participation, which is seen as a good thing in this context. So, their sentiment isn't just acceptance but appreciation for movies that require more from viewers.\n\nThe tone doesn't seem overly enthusiastic; it's more of an approval than excitement.

The user provided the example sentence: \"there are some movies that hit you from the first scene and you know it's going to be a trip.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the sentence carefully. It starts by talking about certain movies that have an impact right from the beginning. The phrase \"hit you from the first scene\" suggests something strong or memorable. Then it says, \"you know it's going to be a trip.\" Now, the word \"trip\" here is a bit ambiguous. In some contexts, it could mean a positive experience, like an adventure or a journey, which would lean towards positive sentiment. But in other cases, \"trip\" might imply something confusing or overwhelming, which could be negative.\n\nBut looking at the sentence as a whole, I think the intended meaning is more on the positive side. The structure seems to describe a movie that's engaging and impactful right from the start, which gives the viewer an expectation of an exciting experience. So, \"a trip\" here probably means an enjoyable ride or journey through the film.\n\nConsidering the scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, I need to figure out where this sentiment falls. The sentence isn't overly enthusiastic; it's more about setting expectations positively without using superlatives. It doesn't express extreme emotions, so maybe a 3 for positive would make sense since it's definitely leaning towards positivity but not extremely so.\n\nI should also think about the context in which this sentence might be used. If someone is recommending a movie, saying it hits you from the first scene and knowing it'll be a trip suggests they had a good experience, hence positive sentiment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I would classify this as 3 because it's positive but not extremely so.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 3, 38.31826702400576], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user provided a statement about a movie, comparing it to its predecessor. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the sentence starts with \"this time, the hype is quieter.\" The word \"quieter\" suggests that there's less buzz or excitement compared before. That could imply lower expectations or maybe less initial enthusiasm, which might lean towards a slightly negative sentiment. But I need to consider the rest of the sentence to get a complete picture.\n\nNext, it says, \"and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first.\" The phrase \"slightly less successful\" indicates that the second movie isn't as good as the first one. This part definitely has a negative connotation because it's pointing out a decrease in success.\n\nHowever, the sentence continues with \"...it's still a rollicking good time for the most part.\" The words \"rollicking good time\" are quite positive, meaning that despite being less successful than the first, the movie is still enjoyable. \"For the most part\" suggests that while there might be some minor drawbacks, overall it's a positive experience.\n\nSo putting it all together: the hype was lower and it's slightly less successful, which are negative points, but the movie is still enjoyable, making it a positive sentiment overall. The negative aspects aren't overpowering; instead, they're balanced by the positive enjoyment factor.\n\nNow, looking at the scale provided\u20140 for very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive\u2014the statement doesn't seem extremely positive or negative. It's a mix of both but leans more towards positive because it ends on an enjoyable note despite some shortcomings.\n\nI think the sentiment here is positive but not overwhelmingly so, so I'll go with a 3, which represents a positive sentiment.\n</think>\n\nThe text mentions that while there was less hype and slightly less success than the first movie, it's still a good time.

The text is: \"Kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the sentence. The subject here is Kapur, who is associated with a particular action in the context of a tale or story.\n\nThe phrase \"weighs down\" suggests that Kapur is adding something heavy or burdensome to the tale. This implies that whatever Kapur is doing is having a negative impact, making the tale feel weighed down or dragged out. The word \"weighs\" itself can have a neutral meaning, but in this context, it's used negatively as it's causing a burden.\n\nNext, the term \"bogus profundities\" stands out. \"Bogus\" clearly indicates something false or fake, and \"profundities\" refers to depth or meaningfulness. So, putting them together, \"bogus profundities\" means that Kapur is introducing ideas or elements that seem deep but are actually insincere or without real substance. This is a critical assessment because it suggests that the supposed depth isn't genuine, which can be frustrating for readers expecting authentic content.\n\nConsidering these points together: The sentence uses negative language to describe Kapur's contribution to the tale. Words like \"weighs down\" and \"bogus\" convey dissatisfaction and criticism. Therefore, the sentiment expressed is negative.\n\nNow, mapping this to the scale provided:\n\n- 0: Very negative\n- 1: Negative\n- 2: Neutral\n- 3: Positive\n- 4: Very positive\n\nThe text isn't extremely harsh (like \"horrifying\" or \"terrible\"), but it does express clear dissatisfaction. So, it's more than just neutral but not the most severe negative. Therefore, a score of 1 (Negative) seems appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is clearly negative due to the use of terms like \"weighs down\" and \"bogus profundities,\" indicating criticism without extreme severity.\n\n1", 1, 1, 43.789037154987454], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me read it again: \"Personal Velocity has a no-frills docu-dogma plainness, yet Miller lingers on invisible, nearly psychic nuances, leaping into digressions of memory and desire.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down each part. The first phrase talks about \"no-frills docu-dogma plainness,\" which sounds pretty straightforward but maybe a bit dry or simple. That could lean towards neutral or slightly negative because it's not very elaborate.\n\nThen the second part says Miller lingers on \"invisible, nearly psychic nuances.\" That seems more positive because it suggests depth and subtlety that aren't obvious. The word \"lingers\" gives me the impression that the author appreciates how Miller takes time to explore these deeper aspects.\n\nThe last part mentions \"leaping into digressions of memory and desire.\" Digressions can sometimes be seen as negative if they're distracting, but in this context, it feels like a positive exploration, adding layers to the story. \n\nPutting it all together, the text seems balanced with both straightforward elements and deeper, more engaging aspects. So, I think the sentiment is neutral because there are both simple and complex elements without leaning heavily positive or negative.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if \"no-frills\" is entirely negative. It could mean that while it's simple, it's also efficient or honest. That might not be as negative as I initially thought. Then the deeper analysis makes me think the overall sentiment leans a bit more towards positive because of the appreciation for subtle nuances and exploration.\n\nHmm, but the first part does use \"plainness,\" which is neutral at best. The second part definitely adds a positive spin. Maybe it's slightly positive? Or perhaps still neutral since there's no strong emotion either way. I'm leaning towards 2 or maybe 3 because of the depth mentioned. But since it starts with something straightforward, not overly negative but also not very positive, I think it's more on the neutral side.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is neutral.

So that's positive.\n\nNext, \"looks, sounds, and feels more like an extended, open-ended poem.\" This suggests a creative, artistic approach rather than a conventional story. Words like \"poem\" evoke emotion and artistry, which are generally positive attributes in a film review.\n\nThere's no negative language here. Everything points towards admiration for the film's unconventional style and its sensory impact. So putting it all together, the sentiment is quite positive. On the scale from 0 to 4, I think this would be a very positive sentiment.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses words like \"grittily beautiful\" and compares the film positively to an extended poem, indicating admiration for its artistic approach.\n\n4", 4, 3, 21.655134614993585], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The adjective used here is \"thought-provoking,\" which means something that causes people to think deeply or carefully about a subject. It doesn't inherently carry a positive or negative connotation; it's more about the effect it has on the audience.\n\nThe word \"picture\" is neutral\u2014it just refers to an image. So, combining both words, the sentiment isn't explicitly positive or negative. However, being thought-provoking can sometimes imply that the content is meaningful or impactful, which people might perceive as a positive attribute. On the other hand, it could also be seen as challenging or difficult, but I don't think that's the primary association here.\n\nI should consider common usage. When someone describes something as thought-provoking, they're usually acknowledging its depth and value without necessarily stating if it's good or bad. So, in most cases, this would lean towards a neutral sentiment because it doesn't express strong emotion either way.\n\nWait, but could there be any nuance I'm missing? Maybe in some contexts, being thought-provoking might imply that the picture is not very pleasant or easy to digest, which could make someone feel confused or challenged. But generally, this term is used positively to highlight the intellectual stimulation it provides. \n\nSo, putting it all together, since there's no explicit positivity or negativity but a slight inclination towards something positive due to the implication of value and depth, I think the sentiment is slightly positive but not strongly so. Therefore, it should be classified as 2 (neutral) because while it's not negative, it doesn't express a strong positive emotion either.\n</think>\n\nThe phrase \"a thought-provoking picture\" uses the adjective \"thought-provoking,\" which suggests that the content is meant to stimulate deep thinking or reflection. This term does not inherently carry a strongly positive or negative connotation; instead, it implies intellectual engagement. Therefore, the sentiment expressed is neutral.\n\n2", 2, 4, 42.18461953397491], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The first part says, \"It's an often-cute film,\" which seems positive. \"Cute\" is a nice word and generally has a positive connotation. So that part would lean towards positive.\n\nBut then there's a \"but\" coming in, which usually signals a contrast or a negative point following the positive one. The second part states that the film either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing. This suggests that the movie might be lacking depth or is too long without enough content. So this part is pointing out shortcomings or areas for improvement.\n\nSo, putting it together: the sentiment isn't entirely negative because there's a positive aspect mentioned first, but it's not all positive either since the film has issues that need addressing. The word \"needs\" implies something is missing, which can be seen as slightly critical.\n\nNow, I have to decide where this falls on the scale from 0 to 4. Since it starts with a compliment and ends with constructive criticism, it doesn't feel overly negative or positive. It's somewhere in the middle. However, since there's a critique pointing out flaws, maybe it leans a bit more neutral or slightly negative.\n\nBut considering that \"often-cute\" is a genuine positive, I don't think it's negative enough to be a 1. It\u2019s not outright negative; it's balanced with both pros and cons. So I'm leaning towards either 2 (neutral) or maybe even 3 if the positive aspect is stronger.\n\nWait, but the criticism part is about needing more substance or editing, which could mean that overall, while there are good parts, the film isn't as strong as it could be. That might make it slightly negative because the critique is suggesting improvements rather than just being a neutral observation.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit torn between 2 and 1. But since the sentence starts with a positive adjective (\"cute\") and then points out areas for improvement without being harshly critical, maybe it's more neutral than negative. Alternatively, perhaps the mention of needing more substance implies that the film doesn't quite meet expectations, which could make it slightly negative.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the sentiment is probably 2 (neutral) because there are both positive and negative elements mentioned, but neither outweighs the other significantly. The positivity from \"often-cute\" balances out the criticism about needing substance or editing.\n</think>\n\nThe text presents a balanced view with both positive and critical aspects. Starting positively by calling it \"often-cute,\" it then critiques the film's need for more substance or editing.

So, \"small movie\" might be neutral or slightly negative if implying it's less ambitious. But then there's \"with a big heart,\" which usually means heartfelt and sincere, often positive.\n\nPutting them together: The movie isn't grand in scale but has strong emotional depth. This combination is generally seen positively because the heartwarming aspect can outweigh the smaller production elements.\n\nI don't detect any strongly negative words, so it's not 0 or 1. It\u2019s clearly more than neutral (2) because of the positive connotations from \"big heart.\" The sentiment isn't extremely positive either, so maybe a 3 is appropriate here.\n\nDouble-checking, are there any hidden negatives?

But then the second part says there's also no reason not to, which might mean they're indifferent. They don't have a strong opinion either way.\n\nSo putting it together, the sentiment seems neutral because there's an absence of clear positive or negative emotion. The speaker isn't recommending against it or encouraging others to see it; they're just stating that both sides lack compelling reasons. \n\nI should also think about any hidden nuances. Maybe the person is undecided or doesn't have enough information. They might not be expressing a strong feeling either way, which again points towards neutrality.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not overcomplicating this. The key here is that there's an equal lack of reasons on both sides, so it's balanced.

The sentence provided is: \"Decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies, newsreels and the like.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the sentence to understand its meaning. Decasia refers to a process where old film stock deteriorates over time due to chemical reactions, leading to discoloration, decomposition, and loss of image quality. It's a form of decay that affects many older films, especially silent movies and newsreels.\n\nThe statement seems to be describing this phenomenon as something that has already affected numerous films. The use of \"already\" suggests that it's a completed action or an ongoing process that has taken place. So the speaker is pointing out that Decasia has happened to many silent movies and newsreels, implying that these materials have deteriorated.\n\nNow, considering sentiment classification: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The statement is factual but carries an undercurrent of concern or sadness because it's talking about the decay and loss of films. Silent movies and newsreels are significant cultural artifacts; their deterioration would be viewed negatively by those who value them.\n\nHowever, the sentence doesn't express overtly negative emotions like anger or despair. It's more of a neutral observation with an implied negative connotation. The focus is on the fact that decay has occurred rather than expressing strong emotion. Therefore, while it's not positive, it's not extremely negative either.\n\nI should consider whether the sentiment leans towards negative but isn't overly so. Since it's pointing out a problem without strong emotional language, maybe it falls into the negative category (1) rather than very negative (0). Alternatively, if the focus is purely informative without much emotion, it could be neutral (2). \n\nBut given that Decasia leads to loss of films, which is unfortunate, I think there's a subtle negative sentiment here. So perhaps it should be classified as 1 (negative).\n</think>\n\nThe statement discusses the decay of silent movies and newsreels due to Decasia, which carries an underlying concern about their deterioration.

The phrase starts with \"a very pretty,\" which are both strong positive adjectives. \"Pretty\" generally has a positive connotation, and adding \"very\" intensifies that sentiment. So together, they suggest something is quite nice or enjoyable.\n\nNext, the term \"after-school special\" usually refers to a type of television show or movie aimed at younger audiences, often dealing with moral lessons or heartfelt stories. These are typically seen as wholesome or positive content, though sometimes they can be criticized for being too preachy or predictable.\n\nPutting it all together, \"a very pretty after-school special\" seems to highlight the attractiveness and likability of such a program. The use of \"very pretty\" adds a layer of enthusiasm or approval. There's no negative language here; instead, the sentiment leans towards positive because of the adjectives used and the context in which they're applied.\n\nSo considering the scale, 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit at all. 1 is negative, but there's nothing negative here. Neutral (2) might be a consideration if the language were more neutral, but \"very pretty\" suggests a positive sentiment. Positive (3) fits well because of the clear positive adjectives and context. Very positive (4) could also be a contender, but I think 3 is appropriate since while it's positive, it doesn't go beyond that into extremely positive territory.\n\nI don't see any hidden nuances or sarcasm in this text that would invert the sentiment, so it should be straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in \"a very pretty after-school special\" is positive due to the use of enthusiastic adjectives. \n\n3", 3, 2, 42.195265851012664], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me start by reading the text carefully: \"neil burger here succeeded in ... making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present.\"\n\nHmm, the key word here seems to be \"succeeded.\" That usually has a positive connotation because it means someone achieved something successfully. So, Neil Burger managed to take an older mystery and use it as a foundation for a current one. The phrase \"springboard\" implies that he built upon the old mystery to create something new and relevant now.\n\nI should consider what each score represents. 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 is neutral, 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive. Since \"succeeded\" is a strong positive word, it's not neutral or negative. Now, I need to decide if this is just positive (3) or very positive (4).\n\nThe sentence doesn't use any superlatives like \"amazingly succeeded\" or \"excellently managed,\" so maybe it's not the highest level of positivity. It's a straightforward success without extra flair. So perhaps 3, which is positive but not extremely so.\n\nWait, could there be any negative undertones? The text doesn't mention anything bad about Neil Burger's work; instead, it highlights his success in connecting past and present mysteries. There's no criticism or dissatisfaction mentioned, so definitely not in the negative range.\n\nTherefore, considering all that, I think the sentiment is positive but not overly enthusiastic, so a score of 3 makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe text positively acknowledges Neil Burger's success in bridging past and present mysteries without extreme enthusiasm. \n\nAnswer: 3", 3, 4, 37.02108320500702], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The use of \"guess\" at the beginning suggests uncertainty or doubt, which also leans towards a negative sentiment.\n\nNext, looking at the overall structure, it's implying that having too much fake blood leads to bad outcomes in filmmaking. This isn't just neutral; it's expressing dissatisfaction or criticism about filmmakers and their creative decisions when given certain resources.\n\nI should consider the intensity of the sentiment. The statement doesn't use extreme language like \"terrible\" or \"disaster,\" but it does express a clear negative outcome. So, while it's negative, it might not be extremely so. Therefore, I'm thinking between 0 (very negative) and 1 (negative). \n\nBut wait, the phrase \"nothing good can happen\" is pretty strong. It suggests that all possible outcomes are bad, which could indicate a stronger negativity than just a simple negative sentiment. On the other hand, it's not using overtly harsh words like \"awful\" or \"horrifying.\"\n\nConsidering these points, I think the sentiment is more towards the very negative side because of the absolute nature of the statement.

It seems like someone is posing a question about creating a movie that has depth, but the subject of the movie is a man who \"lacked any.\" The phrase \"lacked any\" probably refers to lacking depth or substance.\n\nSo, the person is wondering how you can make a deep movie about someone who isn't deep themselves. That could imply that the character might be shallow or lacks certain qualities. But making a movie with depth about such a person might highlight their shortcomings or maybe show growth, but from the question alone, it's unclear if there's any positive spin.\n\nThe sentiment here seems to express some doubt or challenge in creating something meaningful. It doesn't necessarily express outright negativity; instead, it's more of a neutral observation or question. There's no explicit emotion like anger or happiness, just an inquiry about feasibility.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 is very negative, which would involve strong negative emotions. 4 is very positive, with strong positive feelings. This text doesn't seem to reach either extreme. It's somewhere in between. It might lean slightly towards neutral because it's more of a question than an emotional statement. However, the underlying tone could be somewhat negative if we infer that making such a movie is difficult or impossible, hence expressing skepticism.\n\nBut without explicit emotion words, it's safer to classify this as neutral.

It's saying it's not something negative, so this is also a positive statement, albeit somewhat cautiously worded.\n\nPutting them together, both parts are positive but maybe not extremely so. There's no strong emotion like \"amazing\" or \"terrible,\" just neutral-positive terms. So the sentiment leans towards positive but isn't very intense.\n\nI should consider if there's any negativity. The second part could be interpreted as just average acting since it's \"far from painful.\" It doesn't outright praise the acting, so maybe it's slightly positive rather than strongly so.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the sentiment is moderately positive.

It's saying that three people\u2014Director Hoffman, his writer, and Kline's agent\u2014should serve detention. Detention typically refers to a punishment, like being held in custody for some wrongdoing. So suggesting they should be detained implies criticism or blame.\n\nNow, considering the context, if someone is recommending detention for these individuals, it suggests that they are upset or dissatisfied with their actions. This could indicate frustration or anger, which leans towards negative sentiment.\n\nThe sentence doesn't have any positive words or phrases. There's no indication of praise or satisfaction. It's more about a call for punishment, which clearly has a negative connotation.\n\nI should also consider the intensity. The word \"should\" implies a suggestion rather than an absolute statement, but since detention is a serious penalty, it still carries a significant negative charge. However, there's no superlatives like \"terrible\" or \"horrible,\" so maybe it's not the most extreme negative.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment is negative because of the suggestion of punishment, but it doesn't seem extremely harsh in wording.

Then, \"fascinating\" is clearly a positive adjective. \"Psychological fare\" refers to content related to psychology, and while not inherently positive or negative, in this context it's paired with \"fascinating,\" which makes it seem intriguing.\n\nPutting it all together, the text highlights Ratliff's access as extensive and his work as fascinating.

The term \"typical anime\" is neutral on its own but sets the context. Then comes \"cheapo animation,\" which has a negative connotation because \"cheapo\" implies low quality. Comparing it to Saturday morning TV from the '60s adds more negativity, as that era's animation was often seen as simplistic or lower in quality.\n\nNext, there's mention of a \"complex sword-and-sorcery plot.\" While complexity can be good, the way it's presented here doesn't seem overly positive; it's just stating a fact. The characters having big round eyes and Japanese names is also neutral\u2014it describes the style without expressing emotion.\n\nPutting it all together: the main negative point is about the animation quality being cheap. However, there are no extremely harsh words or very strong positive descriptors.

The user has given a specific query: \"can you bear the laughter?\" and wants me to classify its sentiment on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each number represents in terms of sentiment. So, 0 is very negative, which would be something like \"I hate this.\" Then 1 is negative, maybe something like \"This isn't great.\" Neutral is 2, so a statement without strong emotion either way, such as \"The weather is nice.\" Positive is 3, for example, \"I really enjoy this,\" and very positive is 4, like \"This is amazing!\"\n\nNow, looking at the given text: \"can you bear the laughter?\" At first glance, I notice that the word \"laughter\" is generally a positive word because laughing usually indicates happiness or joy. But the phrase is phrased as a question, which might be seeking confirmation or expressing uncertainty.\n\nI should consider the context in which this sentence might be used. It could be someone asking if another person can withstand being around laughter, maybe implying that the laughter is loud or frequent. Alternatively, it could be a rhetorical question, perhaps suggesting that laughter is overwhelming but in a positive sense.\n\nAnother angle is to think about possible negative connotations. If \"bear\" means to tolerate something difficult, then the sentence might imply that the laughter is hard to handle, which would lean towards a slightly negative sentiment. But without more context, it's challenging to determine definitively.\n\nI should also analyze the structure of the sentence. It's a question, so it doesn't express a strong emotion but rather seeks information or reaction. This makes me think it's more neutral than positive or negative because questions typically don't carry as much emotional weight unless they're loaded with sarcasm or tone.\n\nAdditionally, considering common expressions, \"bear the laughter\" isn't a typical phrase I've heard. It might be used in a specific context that's not immediately obvious. If someone says this, they could be testing another person's ability to handle a situation involving laughter, which doesn't inherently have a positive or negative connotation.\n\nI should also think about possible interpretations. Maybe the speaker is suggesting that there will be a lot of laughter, and they're asking if the listener can handle it. In that case, it might imply a fun or joyful environment, leaning towards positive. On the other hand, if the context is someone feeling mocked or laughed at, then \"bear\" could mean enduring something unpleasant, making it negative.\n\nGiven all these possibilities, I need to make an educated guess based on typical usage. Since laughter itself is generally positive and the phrasing isn't overtly negative, but also not clearly positive, the sentiment might lean slightly towards neutral. However, considering that laughter is a positive thing, perhaps the overall sentiment is more positive than negative.\n\nWait, but the question is about whether someone can bear it. So if someone asks if you can handle something, even if it's positive, it could imply that it's intense or challenging. But without knowing the exact context, it's hard to say. Alternatively, maybe the person is inviting others to join in on a fun situation involving laughter.\n\nIn the absence of strong indicators, I think the safest bet is to classify this as neutral (2). However, given that laughter is positive, perhaps there's a slight lean towards positive but not strongly enough to be a 3. Alternatively, if \"bear\" suggests enduring something intense, maybe it's slightly negative.\n\nBut considering that laughter is generally a happy thing and the sentence isn't clearly expressing a negative emotion, I might lean more towards neutral or even positive. But without more context, I'm still hesitant. Maybe I should err on the side of caution and go with 2 for neutral because it doesn't express a clear positive or negative sentiment.\n</think>\n\nThe phrase \"can you bear the laughter?\" involves the word \"laughter,\" which is typically associated with positivity. However, the structure as a question and the use of \"bear\" could imply endurance rather than enjoyment.

The text is: \"lovely and amazing is holofcener's deep, uncompromising curtsy to women she knows, and very likely is.\" \n\nFirst, let me break this down. The words used here are \"lovely\" and \"amazing,\" which are both positive adjectives. They immediately give a sense of admiration or appreciation.\n\nThe phrase continues with \"deep, uncompromising curtsy.\" A curtsy is traditionally a gesture of respect, especially from women, so describing it as deep and uncompromising suggests that the respect shown is genuine and sincere. This adds to the positive sentiment because it implies authenticity in the action.\n\nNext, the text mentions \"women she knows\" and \"very likely is.\" It seems like Holofcener is portraying or paying homage to real women, which could be seen as a respectful and accurate representation. This makes the sentiment more positive because it's about honoring real people.\n\nPutting it all together, the language used is clearly appreciative and complimentary.

Let me read through the text again.\n\nThe sentence is: \"Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break it down. The subject here is Kevin Donovan, a newcomer director (helmer refers to a director). He's being described as \"hamstrung,\" which means constrained or held back. The reason given is a \"badly handled screenplay.\" So the film's script isn't good.\n\nHowever, despite this, the concept of the high-tech tuxedo turning someone into Superman is called \"amusing.\" That seems positive.\n\nSo, on one hand, there's criticism: the director is constrained by a poorly written script. On the other hand, the underlying idea is amusing, which is a positive note.\n\nI need to weigh these aspects. The main point is that the screenplay was badly handled, which negatively impacts the film. But the concept itself has potential. So the sentiment isn't extremely negative because it acknowledges that the idea was amusing. It's more of a mixed or slightly negative review.\n\nConsidering the options: 0 (very negative) seems too harsh because there's a positive aspect mentioned. 1 is negative but not extreme, which fits since the main criticism is about the handling rather than the concept itself. Neutral (2) doesn't capture the slight negativity from the poor screenplay. Positive (3 or 4) isn't right because the focus is on what went wrong.\n\nSo I think it's best classified as 1, negative.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to the criticism of the screenplay despite acknowledging an amusing concept. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 2, 38.92218550600228], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The task is to assign it a score from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive. Let me break down the sentence step by step.\n\nThe sentence given is: \"-lrb- danny huston gives -rrb- an astounding performance that deftly , gradually reveals a real human soul buried beneath a spellbinding serpent 's smirk.\"\n\nFirst, I notice that there are some strange characters at the beginning and middle of the sentence, like \"-lrb-\" and \"-rrb-\". Those look like they might be some kind of formatting errors or perhaps placeholders. So, I can probably ignore those for sentiment analysis purposes.\n\nNow, focusing on the actual content: \"Danny Huston gives an astounding performance...\" The word \"astounding\" stands out here. That's a strong positive adjective, suggesting that the performance was impressive and beyond what is typically expected. \n\nNext part: \"...that deftly, gradually reveals a real human soul.\" \"Deftly\" means skillfully or cleverly, which again is a positive descriptor. \"Gradually reveals a real human soul\" implies depth and emotional complexity in the performance, which are qualities that are generally praised.\n\nFinally, it mentions \"...buried beneath a spellbinding serpent's smirk.\" \"Spellbinding\" suggests something enchanting or captivating, which is definitely a positive trait. The mention of a serpent's smirk might be referring to an alluring or mysterious aspect of the character, but in context, it seems to add to the intrigue rather than criticize.\n\nPutting it all together: the performance is described as astounding, skillfully revealing depth and emotion, and captivating. All these are strong positive indicators with no negative words present. The use of superlatives like \"astounding\" and \"spellbinding\" points towards a very positive sentiment. There's also no ambiguity in the praise; it's straightforward and complimentary.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think this text expresses a very positive sentiment. Therefore, it should be classified as 4, which is very positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses strong positive adjectives like \"astounding\" and \"spellbinding,\" indicating a highly favorable opinion of Danny Huston's performance.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the sentence carefully. It's talking about Chelsea Walls being compared to a situation where too many chefs are involved in preparing a recipe that's too weak. The phrase \"too many chefs\" is often used as an idiom meaning that having too many people trying to contribute can lead to chaos or confusion. So, in this context, it seems like the person is saying Chelsea Walls has had too much input from various people.\n\nNext, the part about \"fussing over too weak a recipe.\" Fussing implies that there's unnecessary attention or effort being put into something. The recipe itself is described as too weak, which probably means it doesn't have enough flavor, strength, or isn't effective. So putting it together, the sentiment seems to be critical of Chelsea Walls because even with all the attention, the end result is still not good.\n\nNow, considering the options: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, and so on up to 4 which is very positive. The text isn't outright attacking Chelsea Walls but rather pointing out that despite efforts (too many chefs), it's still not strong enough (weak recipe). This implies a criticism or dissatisfaction.\n\nI don't think it's neutral because the wording has a clear negative connotation with \"too weak\" and \"fussing over.\" It's not positive at all. So, I need to decide between 0 or 1. Is this very negative or just negative?\n\nThe phrase \"too many chefs\" can sometimes be used humorously, but in this context, it's more about the result being underwhelming because of too much interference. The focus is on the weakness of the recipe despite all the attention. So, while it's a critique, maybe not extremely harsh. Therefore, I might lean towards 1 (negative) rather than 0 (very negative). It's negative but not excessively so.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative because it criticizes Chelsea Walls for being overly managed and underwhelming. The use of \"too weak a recipe\" highlights dissatisfaction.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 47.26728364097653], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence is: \"Imagine Kevin Smith, the blasphemous bad boy of suburban Jersey, if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the words used here. \"Blasphemous bad boy\" sounds negative towards Kevin Smith. Blasphemous usually has a strong negative connotation because it refers to offending sacred beliefs or being disrespectful in a severe way.\n\nNext, the phrase says he's from suburban Jersey. That doesn't have an obvious positive or negative sentiment on its own, so I'll note that but move on.\n\nThe latter part of the sentence is \"if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor.\" Being stripped of a budget suggests financial constraints or loss, which is negative. Losing one's sense of humor can mean becoming more serious or losing the ability to enjoy life, which is also negative.\n\nPutting it all together: Kevin Smith is being described with strong negative terms (\"blasphemous bad boy\"), and then in an imagined scenario where he loses both his budget (resources) and sense of humor. Both elements point towards a negative sentiment.\n\nNow, considering the scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive. The text doesn't use extremely harsh language but still has a clearly negative tone due to the descriptors used and the imagined loss mentioned.\n\nSo I think it's somewhere between 0 and 1. Since \"blasphemous\" is quite strong, maybe leaning towards 0 as the sentiment is very negative.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is very negative due to the harsh descriptions and the imagined loss of resources and humor.\n\n0", 0, 0, 34.92284009399009], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text given is: \"she 's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her bjorkness .\" I need to determine whether the sentiment expressed here is very negative (0), negative (1), neutral (2), positive (3), or very positive (4).\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. The subject is \"she,\" described as \"all-powerful.\" That immediately sounds like a compliment because being all-powerful usually implies strength and influence. Next, she's referred to as \"a voice for a pop-cyber culture.\" This suggests that she represents or speaks for this specific cultural movement, which could be positive if the context is favorable.\n\nThe phrase \"feeds on her bjorkness\" stands out. I'm not entirely sure what \"bjorkness\" refers to. It might be referencing Bj\u00f6rk, an Icelandic musician known for her unique style and contributions to music. If that's the case, then saying a culture feeds on her Bj\u00f6rk-like qualities could imply admiration or emulation, which is positive.\n\nPutting it all together: she's powerful, a cultural representative, and has an influence that others draw from. All these points lean towards a positive sentiment. The terms used don't have negative connotations. \"All-powerful\" and being a voice are strong positive descriptors.\n\nI should consider if there's any ambiguity or sarcasm, but the sentence doesn't seem to indicate that. It's straightforward in its praise of her influence and power within this pop-cyber culture.\n\nSo, evaluating on the scale: 0 is very negative, which isn't the case here. 1 is negative, also not applicable. Neutral (2) might be if the sentiment was indifferent, but the words used are clearly positive. Positive (3) seems appropriate because of the compliments and favorable description without any superlatives that would push it to very positive (4). While she's described as all-powerful, which is strong, the rest doesn't add more layers of positivity beyond 3.\n\nTherefore, I'd classify this sentiment as 3, which is positive.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is positive. \n\nAnswer: 3", 3, 3, 46.63310085699777], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence says: \"The movie spends more time with Schneider than with newcomer McAdams, even though her performance is more interesting (and funnier) than his.\" \n\nHmm, let's break it down. First, the movie focuses more on Schneider. That part doesn't have an emotional charge yet\u2014it's just stating a fact about screen time. But then it says that McAdams' performance is \"more interesting\" and \"funnier,\" which are positive descriptors. So even though the movie gives Schneider more attention, his acting isn't as engaging or amusing as McAdams'. \n\nThe sentiment here seems to be pointing out that McAdams does a better job than Schneider, but she doesn't get as much screen time. That's a bit of a criticism towards the movie for not giving enough focus to the better performer. However, it's not overly negative because it's more of an observation rather than a harsh critique.\n\nSo, considering the options: 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit here. It's not extremely negative but has some criticism. Negative (1) could be possible since there's a slight criticism about the movie's focus. Neutral (2) might also apply because it's more of an analytical statement. But I think the positive aspects of McAdams' performance tip it slightly towards a neutral to positive sentiment, though not very strong. So maybe 2 or even 3.\n\nWait, but the main point is that the movie isn't highlighting the better performer, which could be seen as a flaw. However, the tone isn't harsh; it's more of a factual observation with a hint of disappointment. So I think it leans towards neutral with a slight negative tinge because of the criticism about screen time allocation.\n\nBut since McAdams' performance is praised, that adds a positive element. The overall sentiment might be slightly negative but not enough to go beyond 1. Alternatively, if we consider the positivity from her performance as a stronger factor, it could balance out to neutral. I'm a bit torn between 2 and 1.\n\nIn the end, I think the critical point about screen time allocation is present, so leaning towards 1\u2014negative. But given that it's more of an observation than a strong negative statement, maybe 2 is safer. I'll go with 2 as neutral.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is slightly positive due to praise for McAdams' performance but also points out criticism regarding screen time allocation.

Let's see... The sentence is: \"There's a spontaneity to the chateau, a sense of light-heartedness, that makes it attractive throughout.\" Hmm.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the words used here. \"Spontaneity\" usually has a positive connotation; it suggests something fun or lively without being forced. Then there's \"light-heartedness,\" which definitely sounds positive\u2014happy, carefree. Both of these adjectives are describing the chateau.\n\nThe phrase ends with saying that this makes the chateau attractive throughout. \"Attractive\" is clearly a positive word. So putting it all together, each part contributes to an overall positive feeling about the place.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. Everything points towards positivity\u2014spontaneity, light-heartedness, and attractiveness. There's no doubt or hesitation in the statement; it's straightforward in its praise.\n\nSo considering the scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive), this should be on the higher end. It feels very positive because all descriptors are positive without any neutral or negative elements.\n\nWait, could \"light-heartedness\" sometimes be seen as too casual? Maybe, but in context, it's paired with spontaneity and attractiveness, so it reinforces a positive vibe. I don't think there's any ambiguity here.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment is very positive. That would be a 4.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses positive words like \"spontaneity,\" \"light-heartedness,\" and \"attractive,\" indicating an overall positive sentiment. \n\n4", 4, 3, 33.496679216012126], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase \"breathes life\" suggests a positive transformation, making something more dynamic and engaging. This implies that Foster's performance added value where there might not have been much before.\n\nThe words used are clearly positive. \"Breathes life\" is a strong positive expression indicating that Foster made the role stand out. Without Foster, it could have been just average or even worse, but with their contribution, it became something more compelling.\n\nThere's no negative language here; instead, it's highlighting improvement and enhancement. The sentiment isn't just slightly positive but quite strong because it suggests a significant impact by Foster.\n\nSo considering the scale, 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive. Since the text uses an enthusiastic expression about Foster's contribution, I think it leans towards very positive rather than just positive. Therefore, the sentiment should be classified as 4.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a strong positive sentiment, highlighting that Foster significantly enhanced a role that could have been average.\n\n4", 4, 3, 31.031829449988436], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user provided a sentence: \"It desperately wants to be a wacky, screwball comedy, but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the components. The first part says it \"desperately wants\" to be a comedy. That might suggest some effort, but using \"desperately\" could imply that it's not succeeding well. Then, the second part talks about how many talented people were convinced to waste their time. Wasting time is negative, and mentioning talented people adds weight to that criticism.\n\nSo overall, the sentiment seems negative because it's pointing out a failure in what was intended as a comedy and criticizes the involvement of talent in something deemed a waste. The use of \"desperately\" and \"waste their time\" are strong indicators. I'm leaning towards 1 for negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses dissatisfaction with a project that failed to achieve its comedic goals, criticizing the involvement of talented individuals in what was perceived as a wasted effort.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 0, 22.453153136972105], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts with \"what might 've been,\" which suggests some potential or expectation. Then there's \"an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle.\" Exhilarating is a strong positive word, indicating something exciting and thrilling. So initially, it sounds positive.\n\nBut then the sentence takes a turn: \"becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors.\" Now, \"sprawl\" usually implies something spread out in a disorganized way, which isn't great. \"Uncoordinated\" means lacking order or direction, so that's not good either. Vectors can refer to directions or forces, but here it seems like they're just scattered and not working together.\n\nPutting it all together: the initial part sets up a positive expectation of an exhilarating exploration. But then it says this potential wasn't realized\u2014it instead became a mess with no direction. So the sentiment shifts from potential positivity to actual negativity.\n\nI'm thinking about how strong this negative is. The text doesn't use extremely harsh words, but it does express disappointment. Words like \"might 've been\" indicate that something was expected or hoped for, which wasn't achieved. Instead of being exhilarating, it's just a sprawl without coordination.\n\nSo the sentiment isn't extremely negative (like 0) because there aren't any swear words or very harsh adjectives. It's more on the disappointed side but not completely devastating.

He balances deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes showing women receiving telegrams from the war department. \n\nFirst, I notice that the word \"smart\" is a positive adjective, which already tilts the sentiment towards positivity. The use of \"vary the pitch\" suggests adaptability and creativity in filmmaking, which are favorable traits.\n\nThe text mentions two types of scenes: battle scenes that are deafening (intense) and domestic scenes that are quieter. This balance indicates depth and complexity in the movie, showing different aspects of life during war\u2014both the chaos of battles and the emotional impact at home. \n\nWords like \"balance\" imply that Wallace is effectively managing contrasting elements, which is a compliment to his filmmaking skills. The domestic scenes focus on women receiving telegrams, likely about their loved ones being in the war. This part might evoke some emotion but isn't overtly negative; instead, it adds realism and emotional depth.\n\nOverall, the sentiment seems positive because it praises Wallace's approach and the thoughtfulness behind the movie's structure. There's no indication of negativity here\u2014no complaints or criticisms mentioned.

The user provided a sentence that says: \"the pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break it down. The sentence starts by saying the pairing sounds \"promising in theory,\" which is a positive note. That suggests there's potential or hope for something good. But then it quickly turns with a \"but\" \u2013 that usually indicates contrast, so probably negative. \n\nThe next part mentions their lack of chemistry making Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro look like old vaudeville partners on Showtime. Wait, I know Showtime is a series where Murphy and DeNiro play FBI agents. The comparison to vaudeville partners might be implying that they have good chemistry, but here it's saying that the pairing in question lacks chemistry so much that even Murphy and DeNiro look like great friends by comparison.\n\nSo putting it together: The first part is positive, but the second part is definitely negative because of the lack of chemistry. The use of \"lack\" and comparing to a well-known pair (Murphy and DeNiro) who are famous for their dynamic suggests that this pairing isn't working as expected.\n\nI need to rate this on a scale from 0 to 4, with 0 being very negative and 4 very positive.

The sentence starts with something positive\u2014something beginning \"brightly.\" That gives an initial positive vibe. But then it takes a turn: the subject gets \"bogged down,\" which isn't good. Being bogged down usually means facing problems or difficulties, so that's a negative aspect.\n\nThe phrase \"over 140 minutes\" adds context about the duration. It suggests that whatever started well didn't stay that way; it became tiresome or dragged on too long. So overall, there's a mix of starting positive but ending up with a negative outcome.\n\nI need to assess how strong this sentiment is. The initial positivity isn't enough to make the whole statement positive because the latter part overpowers it with negativity. However, since it starts bright and then becomes bogged down, maybe it's not extremely negative but leans towards negative. \n\nSo considering the scale: 0 for very negative, 1 for negative, 2 neutral, etc. This seems to be on the negative side because of \"bogged down,\" which isn't a minor issue.

It's often used positively in contexts where people appreciate being challenged intellectually. So this adds another layer of positivity.\n\n\"Even an engaging mystery.\" \u2013 The word \"engaging\" here means interesting and captivating, which is a positive descriptor.

So my job is to analyze the text given and assign one of those integers.\n\nLooking at the sentence, I notice that it's about a performance by Allison Lohman. The word \"marvelous\" stands out here. I know that \"marvelous\" is a strong positive adjective, meaning something is excellent or wonderful. So right away, this suggests a positive sentiment.\n\nNext, the sentence describes her role as an identity-seeking foster child. Foster children often face challenges, but without more context, it's hard to say if the portrayal itself is negative or positive. However, since the focus is on the performance being marvelous, that likely takes precedence in determining the sentiment.\n\nI should consider any other words that might influence the sentiment. The rest of the sentence seems descriptive rather than emotional. There are no negative adjectives here; it's more about highlighting her role and the quality of her work.\n\nPutting this together, the use of \"marvelous\" indicates a strong positive feeling towards Allison Lohman's performance. So on the scale provided, I would lean towards the higher end. Since 4 is very positive and 3 is just positive, \"marvelous\" feels like it should be a 4 because it's quite an enthusiastic word.\n\nI don't think there are any elements that contradict this positivity. The sentence doesn't mention anything negative about the performance or her role. It's all about praise for her work.\n\nSo my conclusion is that the sentiment here is very positive, which corresponds to the integer 4.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is very positive due to the use of the word \"marvelous,\" indicating strong approval and enthusiasm.\n\n4", 4, 3, 38.807374452997465], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase \"Sunshine state\" might refer to Florida, which is known as the Sunshine State. But in this context, it could just be a general term. The verbs used are \"surveys,\" \"assesses,\" and \"passion.\" \n\nSurveys and assesses are neutral or slightly positive actions because they imply analysis and understanding. The word \"passion\" definitely adds a positive connotation here because passion usually indicates enthusiasm or strong interest. So, putting it all together, the text is talking about someone who is actively looking at issues with dedication to sociology.\n\nThere's nothing negative in this statement. No complaints or criticism are mentioned; instead, there's an emphasis on examining and showing passion for a field of study. That makes me think the sentiment is positive but not extremely so\u2014maybe a 3 or 4. However, since it's more about the activity than expressing strong emotion, I lean towards 3 (positive) rather than 4 (very positive). \n\nI should also consider if any words could be interpreted negatively, but \"surveys,\" \"assesses,\" and \"passion\" all seem neutral to positive. So, the overall sentiment is definitely on the positive side without being overly effusive.\n</think>\n\nThe text conveys a positive sentiment as it highlights passion for sociology through actions of analysis.\n\n3", 3, 2, 32.933833332994254], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user provided a text: \"It's an ambitious film, and as with all ambitious films, it has some problems.\" They want me to classify the sentiment on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the overall tone. The sentence starts by calling the film \"ambitious,\" which can be seen as a compliment because ambitious usually implies creativity or boldness. However, it's followed by mentioning that all ambitious films have some problems. So while there's a positive adjective at the beginning, the latter part brings in issues.\n\nI should consider whether the negative aspect outweighs the positive here. The mention of \"problems\" suggests some dissatisfaction, but the way it's phrased might indicate that these are expected or common for such films rather than severe flaws. It doesn't sound overly negative because it acknowledges the ambition first and then points out typical issues without being too harsh.\n\nLooking at the sentiment scale, 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit here since there's a positive element. Negative (1) might be an option, but the initial compliment makes me think the overall sentiment isn't purely negative. Neutral (2) seems plausible because it balances both positive and negative aspects without leaning heavily either way.\n\nPositive (3 or 4) doesn't seem right because while ambitious is good, the mention of problems tempers that positivity. So balancing these elements, neutral feels like the most accurate classification.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 3, 31.977756558015244], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase starts with \"a hidden-agenda drama,\" which might suggest some intrigue or complexity in the plot. Hidden agendas can sometimes imply suspense or mystery, which could be seen as a positive aspect depending on the context.\n\nThen it says \"that shouts classic french nuance.\" The word \"shouts\" is interesting here because it's typically used to describe something that stands out loudly or assertively. In this case, it's referring to French nuance, which often connotes sophistication and depth. So putting those together, the sentence seems to be describing a drama that not only has an intriguing plot but also carries with it rich, classic elements typical of French cinema.\n\nNow, considering sentiment analysis: words like \"hidden-agenda\" don't inherently carry a negative or positive connotation; they describe the type of story. However, combining that with \"shouts\" and \"classic french nuance,\" it feels more appreciative than critical. The use of \"shouts\" might indicate that these aspects are prominent and perhaps praised.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being a neutral to slightly positive sentiment because while there's no overtly positive language like \"amazing\" or \"excellent,\" the description is highlighting elements that are often valued in dramas\u2014complexity, nuance. The absence of negative words like \"fails\" or \"disappointing\" also suggests it's not\u8d1f\u9762.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think this sentiment would be neutral but with a slight positive tilt because it's pointing out notable features without any criticism.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 2, 39.288933267001994], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It mentions an \"uneven mix,\" which suggests that there's a combination of elements but they don't blend well together. That could imply some level of dissatisfaction or criticism because it's not seamless.\n\nNext, looking at the components: \"dark satire\" and \"childhood awakening.\" Dark satire typically involves humor that is critical or mocking, often pointing out societal issues in a harsh way. While satire itself can be positive in its intent to critique, the adjective \"dark\" might add a more pessimistic or negative tone.\n\nOn the other hand, \"childhood awakening\" sounds like it's about personal growth or realizing something important during childhood. That could have a positive connotation because awakenings often lead to self-discovery or understanding.\n\nSo putting it together: The mix is uneven, which isn't great, and while one part (dark satire) might be negative or critical, the other (childhood awakening) seems more neutral or slightly positive. Since it's an \"uneven\" mix, maybe the overall sentiment leans towards a neutral or slightly negative side because of the adjective used to describe the combination.\n\nI don't think it's very negative because there's no strong negative language beyond \"dark.\" It also doesn't seem very positive since \"childhood awakening\" isn't overly effusive. The word \"uneven\" might make it a bit on the lower end but not extremely so.\n\nSo, considering all this, I'd say the sentiment is neutral or slightly negative. That would translate to either 1 (negative) or 2 (neutral). Since \"dark satire\" can be critical and \"uneven mix\" isn't positive, maybe leaning towards a 1 for negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text combines elements that are both critical and personal, but the overall sentiment is slightly negative due to the \"uneven\" mix. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 44.35297287200228], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Also, it mentions that the fact they're Oscar winners seems inconceivable while watching this movie, implying that their performance here isn't up to par with what one would expect from Oscar winners.\n\nSo, putting this together, the sentiment is negative because it's pointing out a perceived decline or poor acting by these actors in this particular film. It's not extremely negative, but definitely has a critical tone.

The output needs to be an integer from 0 to 4, where each number corresponds to different levels of negativity or positivity.\n\nThe text provided is: \"thanks to a small star with big heart , this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all .\" I need to figure out how positive or negative this sentiment is.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The phrase \"thanks to a small star with big heart\" seems positive because it's praising someone (a star) who has a big heart, indicating kindness or generosity. Then, it mentions that the family film sequel is \"plenty of fun for all.\" That definitely sounds positive since 'fun' and 'all' suggest enjoyment across different age groups.\n\nI should consider keywords like \"thanks,\" \"big heart,\" and \"plenty of fun.\" These are strong indicators of a positive sentiment. There's no negative language here, so the sentiment isn't neutral or negative. It's clearly leaning towards positive.\n\nNow, determining the level of positivity. The text is effusive in its praise, using words like \"plenty\" to emphasize how much fun it is. That makes me think it's more than just a little positive; it's quite positive. However, does it reach 'very positive'? Sometimes very positive might include superlatives or stronger emotional language.\n\nIn this case, while the sentiment is positive and enthusiastic, it doesn't use extremely strong words like \"amazing\" or \"incredible.\" It's more about being fun for all. So maybe a 3 on the scale since 4 would be reserved for even more effusive praise.\n\nWait, but considering the context, family films often aim to be enjoyable for everyone, so calling it \"plenty of fun for all\" is quite positive and might warrant a higher score. Maybe I should go with 4 because it's effectively recommending it as very enjoyable.\n\nHmm, but sometimes people use 'plenty' just to mean sufficient rather than exceptional. So perhaps it's more of a solid positive without being extremely so. That would lean towards a 3 instead of a 4.\n\nI think the key is that there are no negative words and the adjectives used are clearly positive. The overall tone suggests satisfaction and enjoyment, making it a very positive sentiment. Therefore, I'll go with 4.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 4, 47.393116074003046], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts with \"a compelling yarn,\" which suggests that the speaker finds it interesting or engaging. \"Compelling\" is a positive adjective here, indicating something that holds attention effectively. So this part seems positive.\n\nHowever, the second part says, \"but not quite a ripping one.\" The use of \"but\" indicates a contrast to what was previously stated. \"Ripping\" in this context likely means exciting or thrilling. By saying it's \"not quite,\" the speaker is downplaying the excitement factor. So while the story is compelling, it doesn't reach the level of being extremely exciting or gripping.\n\nPutting these together, the sentiment isn't entirely positive because there's a slight criticism about not being as thrilling as expected. But it's not negative either since the main adjective used is positive. It seems like a balanced view where the speaker appreciates the story but finds it lacking in some aspects.\n\nConsidering the scale:\n- 0: Very Negative\n- 1: Negative\n- 2: Neutral\n- 3: Positive\n- 4: Very Positive\n\nThe sentiment isn't extremely negative or positive.

The user is talking about a character named Cal and their experience spending time with him in some context, maybe a movie or a play since it mentions 110 minutes. \n\nLooking at the adjectives used: \"unpleasantly shallow\" \u2013 that's definitely negative. \"Shallow\" means lacking depth, and adding \"unpleasantly\" makes it even more negative. Then, \"immature character\" is another negative descriptor. Immaturity isn't usually seen as a positive trait.\n\nNext part: \"with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes.\" Claustrophobic suggests that the experience felt confined or uncomfortable, which again leans towards a negative sentiment. The use of \"claustrophobic\" adds to the overall unpleasant feeling described.\n\nPutting it all together, the person is expressing dissatisfaction with the character and their experience. They're using strong negative words without any positive counterpoints. So this seems pretty negative.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, which would be if there's extreme negativity. This text doesn't use extremely harsh language beyond \"unpleasantly\" and \"claustrophobic,\" but it's definitely negative. It doesn't reach a neutral or positive sentiment at all. So I think it falls under negative, which is 1.\n\nWait, but the words are quite strong\u2014maybe it's more than just negative?

The text given is: \"pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down what this sentence is saying. It's telling someone to pretend that their SAT scores are below 120. I know that SAT scores range from 400 to 1600, so a score below 120 is extremely low. That\u2019s really bad because even the lowest possible score is 400, so this seems like an exaggeration or maybe a hypothetical scenario.\n\nThe second part says \"you might not notice the flaws.\" So if someone pretends their SAT scores are that low, they might overlook some issues or defects. It could imply that having such a low score would make one less critical of something, perhaps because they're focused on improving their SATs or maybe it's pointing out that with such a low score, certain flaws aren't apparent.\n\nNow, thinking about the sentiment: The first part is making fun of someone by saying their scores are so low. That seems negative. It might be sarcastic or mocking, which usually carries a negative connotation. However, the second part suggests that not noticing flaws could be either positive or negative depending on context. If you don't notice flaws, maybe it's because you're content with your situation, which could be neutral or even slightly positive if it means being less stressed about imperfections.\n\nBut overall, the main sentiment here is probably negative because it's pointing out a flaw in someone else (their SAT scores) and implying that they can't see other flaws because of their own shortcomings. It might also carry an element of criticism towards someone who doesn't realize their own issues.\n\nI think the sentiment isn't extremely negative because it's not using harsh language, but it does have a critical tone. So maybe it's around a 1 or 0. However, since it's more about pointing out flaws rather than being outright hostile, I might lean towards 0 (very negative) because the implication of having such low SAT scores is quite severe and could be seen as very negative.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the user is advising someone to pretend their scores are low to avoid noticing flaws, it's a bit more nuanced. Maybe they're suggesting a coping mechanism, which might not be entirely negative but still critical.

It's a simple statement that conveys enthusiasm without any hesitation.\n\nSince \"loved\" is quite strong compared to words like \"liked,\" which might be more moderate, this suggests a higher positivity level.

The user provided the sentence: \"it's mildly amusing, but I certainly can't recommend it.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the sentence. The phrase \"mildly amusing\" suggests a slightly positive feeling because \"amusing\" is generally a positive word, and \"mildly\" softens that positivity. However, the second part of the sentence says \"I certainly can't recommend it,\" which is clearly negative because recommending something implies approval or satisfaction, and not being able to do so indicates dissatisfaction.\n\nNow, I have two conflicting sentiments here: a slight positive and a definite negative. The task is to weigh these against each other. Since the user can't recommend it despite finding it mildly amusing, the overall sentiment leans more towards neutral rather than fully negative or positive. \n\nIf I were to rate this on a scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, \"mildly amusing\" would be around a 3, but the inability to recommend brings it down. However, since there's no outright strong negative language beyond not recommending, it doesn't reach a full negative score of 1 or 0. It's somewhere in the middle between neutral and slightly negative.\n\nConsidering that the recommendation part carries more weight than just finding something amusing, I think the sentiment is closer to neutral but with a slight negative tilt.

The sentence given is: \"The rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. It starts with a positive note about \"The Rock\" having a great presence. That suggests that part is favorable. However, then it contrasts with \"but,\" indicating a shift to something less positive.\n\nThe second part talks about battles and CGI effects. It says that multiple battles aren't the same as one battle followed by impressive CGI. This could imply that while there are several battles, they might not be as impactful or exciting as having one good battle and then strong visual effects. So this comparison is a bit negative because it's pointing out a lack of something better.\n\nPutting it together: The sentence has both positive and negative elements. The initial part is positive about The Rock's presence, but the latter part is critical of the pacing or variety in battles compared to CGI effects. Since there are both aspects, I need to weigh which sentiment is stronger.\n\nThe positive part is straightforward and strong, but the negative comparison is also notable. However, because the sentence starts with a compliment and then criticizes the structure, it's not entirely negative. It's more of a mixed sentiment leaning towards neutral or slightly negative because the criticism is about what could be improved.\n\nConsidering the options, 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit because there's a positive element. 1 is negative, but again, there's that positive start. 2 is neutral, which might capture the balanced view here. However, since the negative part comes after \"but,\" it might carry more weight in the overall sentiment.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the structure: the first half is positive (great presence), and the second is a criticism about repetition vs. quality effects. So maybe the sentiment isn't overly negative but rather points out an issue without being harshly critical. It's pointing out that having multiple battles doesn't equal one battle with great CGI, which suggests dissatisfaction with the approach.\n\nTherefore, I think the overall sentiment leans more towards neutral or slightly negative because of the criticism. But since it starts positively and then criticizes a specific aspect, maybe it's still somewhat balanced. However, given that the negative part is about what could have been better, perhaps it's not too harsh. So maybe 2 (neutral) isn't capturing the slight negativity. Alternatively, if I think of it as more critical than positive, maybe it's slightly negative.\n\nBut wait, \"one battle after another\" might be seen as repetitive and less engaging compared to having one good battle with strong CGI. That does sound like a criticism, which makes me lean towards 1 (negative). But the initial part is definitely positive. It's a bit tricky because both elements are present. However, since it starts positive and then contrasts with something negative, perhaps the sentiment is more on the negative side.\n\nBut I'm not sure if it's strong enough to be a full negative (1) or just neutral. Maybe it's somewhere between 2 and 3. Wait, no, because the first part is positive but the second is negative. So the overall sentiment would be somewhat mixed. Since the options are limited, perhaps it's better to go with slightly negative, so 1.\n\nWait, another angle: The sentence doesn't use strong negative words like \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" It just says that multiple battles aren't as good as one battle plus killer CGI. So maybe it's not very negative but more of a critique without strong emotion. Therefore, perhaps it's neutral (2). But since the user provided an example where they classified it as 1, maybe I should consider their reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, in the initial sentence, the positive part is there, but the negative comparison might be more impactful.

However, it's paired with \"failure,\" which is clearly negative. So there's a mix here.\n\nThe phrase \"ambitious failure\" seems to imply that while the goal was big (ambitious), it didn't achieve its intended success (failure). This creates a sense of disappointment but also acknowledges some level of effort or vision, which might not be entirely negative.\n\nLooking at the overall structure, the sentence is stating that something fits the definition of this term.

But since it's described as ambitious, there's a slight nuance that prevents it from being extremely negative.\n\nI think this falls into the negative category but not the most extreme. So, probably a 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is classified as negative due to the term \"failure,\" though tempered by the ambition aspect.

Then, describing these as \"old-fashioned\" and \"outdated\" clearly shows disapproval. The phrase \"dare I say\" adds emphasis, making it seem like the speaker is being critical. \n\nThe second part says it's a wonder he couldn't have brought something fresher by accident. This suggests that even accidentally bringing something new or better would be surprising, which again points to criticism of Attal for not offering anything innovative.\n\nSo overall, the sentiment is negative because of the use of words like old-fashioned, outdated, and the implication that Attal failed to contribute positively.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 1, 24.118194356007734], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence is: \"it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week's reign of fire.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break it down. The person is talking about not having a good cheesy B-movie in theaters for some time until \"Reign of Fire\" came out last week. So they're saying that recently, there was a good one. \n\nThe words to look at are \"good\" and \"cheesy b-movie.\" Cheesy here isn't negative; it's more about being over-the-top or campy in a fun way. They\u2019re probably expressing satisfaction because such movies aren\u2019t common anymore, but they enjoyed this one.\n\nSo the sentiment seems positive. The person is happy that there was finally a good cheesy B-movie to watch. I don't see any negative words here; it's more about the appreciation of something enjoyable after a lack. \n\nSince the scale is 0 for very negative and 4 for very positive, this should be towards the higher end. Maybe a 3 or 4. Since they used \"good,\" which is positive but not extremely so, perhaps a 3 (positive) would fit better than 4.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is positive because the person appreciates the return of a good cheesy B-movie with \"Reign of Fire.\" \n\nAnswer: 3", 3, 1, 30.101518529001623], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It seems like someone is talking about a movie and mentions funk, which I think is referring to the music genre or maybe the overall vibe of the movie. The phrase \"we want the funk\" suggests they were looking for that particular style or feel in the movie.\n\nThen it says \"and this movie's got it.\" The word \"got\" here means the movie possesses what they wanted, so that seems positive because their desire was fulfilled. There's also an exclamation mark after \"it,\" which adds emphasis and excitement to the statement.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. Everything points towards satisfaction with the movie delivering what they were seeking. The use of \"got it\" is a strong affirmative, indicating that their expectations were met or exceeded. \n\nConsidering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. Since there's excitement and fulfillment expressed, I think this falls under positive sentiment but not extremely so. Maybe a 3? Alternatively, if \"very positive\" requires more effusive language, perhaps it's just positive at level 3.\n\nWait, the phrase is enthusiastic, using \"got it\" with an exclamation. That could lean towards very positive. So maybe it's a 4. But I'm not sure if that's overstepping since the sentence isn't extremely long or loaded with superlatives. It's straightforward but positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a 3 because while it's positive, it doesn't use super strong words like \"amazing\" or \"fantastic.\" It just states that the movie has what they wanted. Hmm. I'm a bit torn between 3 and 4 here.\n\nAnother angle: in sentiment analysis, sometimes exclamation marks can indicate stronger emotion. So if someone uses an exclamation after saying the movie got it, that might be more positive. Therefore, maybe it's a 4 for very positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses satisfaction with the movie delivering what was desired, using enthusiastic language. \n\n4", 4, 3, 47.18111104000127], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase starts with \"the film's most improbable feat.\" The word \"improbable\" suggests something unlikely or unexpected. Depending on context, this can be seen in a negative or neutral light. If something is improbable in a bad way, it might mean it's hard to believe or doesn't make sense, which could be negative. However, without more context, it's unclear if the improbability is being criticized or praised.\n\nThe question mark at the end adds uncertainty. It could indicate surprise, confusion, or even admiration for how unlikely something was achieved. For example, in a positive review, someone might say, \"How did they pull that off?\" with awe. On the other hand, it could be a rhetorical question expressing doubt about the film's quality.\n\nSince there are no strong positive or negative adjectives here, just \"improbable,\" which is neutral leaning slightly towards negative if implying disbelief. But without more context, it's safer to assume neutrality because the sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative. \n\nSo, I think this sentence has a neutral sentiment.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 1, 28.167162745987298], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It can sometimes imply a lack of grandeur but doesn't necessarily carry a negative connotation. Then there's \"masterpiece,\" which is clearly a strong positive word. A masterpiece is considered a work of exceptional quality.\n\nPutting them together, the phrase suggests that while it might not be overly extravagant (\"modest\"), it's still a masterpiece. So the sentiment here seems to lean more towards positive because \"masterpiece\" is such a strong positive term. However, since it's described as modest, maybe it's not extremely positive but definitely on the higher side.\n\nSo I'm thinking between 3 and 4. But does \"modest\" temper the positivity enough? If someone calls something a masterpiece, that's usually very positive, so adding \"modest\" might just be a way to say it's a great work without being overly boastful. Therefore, it should still be quite positive but maybe not the highest possible. So perhaps 3 is more appropriate than 4.\n\nWait, but sometimes people use \"modest\" in a way that slightly downplays something they actually admire. Maybe it's a bit understated praise. Still, overall, \"masterpiece\" dominates the sentiment here, so I think 3 makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe text combines \"modest\" with \"masterpiece,\" where the latter strongly conveys positive sentiment despite the former suggesting simplicity. The overall tone is positive but not extremely so.\n\n3", 3, 3, 36.161019665014464], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The first part says that exploring value choices in a film is worthwhile, which seems positive. It's suggesting that such topics are valuable and worth pursuing in filmmaking.\n\nBut then there's a contrast with \"but here.\" That indicates a shift in sentiment. So whatever comes after is probably negative or critical. The next part describes the choices as contrived and artificial. Contrived means something is unnatural or forced, and artificial suggests it's not genuine. These are both negative adjectives used to critique how the film handles value choices.\n\nThe comparison made is with Kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair. Now, without knowing the context of who Kerrigan is, I can assume that her blonde hair might be a trait that's seen as unnatural or over-the-top. So the analogy here is drawing a parallel between something artificial (her hair) and the contrived nature of the film's choices.\n\nPutting it all together: The first part is positive about the topic, but the second part criticizes how it's executed in this specific film. The use of \"contrived\" and \"artificial\" are strong negative terms. So even though there's a positive opening, the critique that follows is quite harsh.\n\nI need to decide on the sentiment score. Since the criticism is significant and uses strong language, I think it leans towards being negative. But because it starts with a positive note before turning critical, it might not be the most extremely negative. So maybe a 1 for negative instead of 0 (very negative). Alternatively, if the negative part is dominant enough, could it be 0? \n\nBut in sentiment analysis, sometimes the presence of both positive and negative can lead to a neutral score. However, since the negative critique is more prominent and critical, I think the overall sentiment is more on the negative side. The first part sets up an expectation but then immediately undermines it with strong criticism.\n\nSo considering all that, I would classify this as 1 (negative) because while there's a positive element at the beginning, the majority of the statement focuses on criticizing how the topic was handled in the film.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed is negative due to the critique of contrived and artificial choices in the film. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 2, 52.59117231599521], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Those seem conflicting. Heartbreaking is negative, while heartwarming is positive. So there's a mix of emotions here.\n\nThen there's the part about being a simple fable in an artless style. \"Artless\" might be neutral or slightly negative because it could imply simplicity without much flair. But then it says it's \"tremendously moving.\" That's definitely a strong positive word.\n\nPutting it all together, even though there are some bittersweet elements (heartbreaking and heartwarming), the overall feeling leans towards being very positive because of how moving it is described as.

Let me read the text again: \"kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the words used. The phrase starts with \"kids should have,\" which indicates that it's talking about children's experience. Then, \"a stirring time\" \u2013 \"stirring\" usually means something exciting or moving, so that seems positive. It suggests that the kids will be engaged and perhaps emotionally moved.\n\nNext, \"beautifully drawn movie.\" The word \"beautifully\" is a strong positive adjective, describing the animation or visuals as being of high quality. This complements the previous part about it being stirring.\n\nPutting it together, both parts of the sentence are expressing positive sentiments. The movie is described in appealing terms, indicating that it's enjoyable and visually impressive for children. There's no negative language here; everything points towards a positive experience.\n\nSo, considering the scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, this text doesn't express extreme positivity but definitely leans towards being positive. The use of \"stirring\" and \"beautifully drawn\" are strong indicators without any superlatives that would make it a 4. Therefore, I think assigning a 3 (positive) makes sense here.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is positive.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify Key Words**: The words \"stirring time\" and \"beautifully drawn\" are key indicators of sentiment.\n2. **Analyze Sentiment**: \n   - \"Stirring\" implies something moving or exciting, which is a positive connotation.\n   - \"Beautifully drawn\" suggests high quality in visuals, another positive aspect.\n3. **Determine Intensity**: Both terms are positive but not overly extreme, indicating a moderate positive sentiment.\n4. **Assign Value**: On the scale provided, 3 represents positive sentiment.\n\nAnswer: 3", 3, 4, 41.839662507001776], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence provided is: \"it jumps around with little logic or continuity, presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular, anciently demanding m\u00e9tier.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the text word by word.\n\nThe first part says it \"jumps around with little logic or continuity.\" This suggests that something is disjointed and lacks structure. The use of \"little\" implies that there isn't much logic or continuity, which sounds negative.\n\nNext, it mentions \"presenting backstage bytes of information.\" \"Backstage\" might imply behind-the-scenes or unpolished content, and \"bytes\" could be a play on words between 'bits' of info and the term 'bytes,' but overall, it seems like these are fragmented pieces. \n\nThen it says \"that never amount to a satisfying complete picture.\" The word \"never\" is strong, indicating that despite all these bytes, they don't come together into something whole or satisfactory. This definitely has a negative connotation.\n\nThe last part refers to this as \"this particular, anciently demanding m\u00e9tier.\" \"Anciently demanding\" suggests that the subject (m\u00e9tier) has been around for a long time and is challenging, which could be neutral or slightly positive depending on context, but in this sentence, it's described with frustration because the information doesn't add up to a satisfying picture.\n\nPutting it all together: The text is criticizing something for being chaotic, disjointed, fragmented, and unsatisfying. There are no positive words here; everything points towards dissatisfaction and frustration. So, how negative is that?\n\nConsidering the scale:\n0 - Very Negative\n1 - Negative\n2 - Neutral\n3 - Positive\n4 - Very Positive\n\nThe sentiment expressed is clearly negative. The question now is whether it's very negative (0) or just negative (1). The text uses strong language like \"little,\" \"never amount to a satisfying complete picture.\" This indicates significant dissatisfaction, leaning towards being very negative. However, sometimes people might use stronger terms without the intensity matching the extreme end. But given the cumulative effect of the descriptors, I think it's on the lower end but not the absolute worst (which would be 0). So perhaps a 1 for Negative.\n\nWait, but another thought: If something is \"jumps around with little logic or continuity\" and doesn't provide a satisfying picture, maybe that's more towards very negative because it's completely unsatisfying. But in sentiment analysis, sometimes \"very negative\" might be reserved for stronger emotions like anger or disgust. Here, it's more frustration or disappointment, which could fit into 1 (Negative) rather than 0.\n\nAlternatively, if the user feels strongly that this is a very negative statement, they might choose 0.

My job is to figure out where \"so-so\" falls into this scale.\n\nThe phrase \"so-so\" generally means that something is neither good nor bad; it's average or mediocre. So when someone says the entertainment was so-so, they're not expressing a strong positive or negative emotion. It's more like a neutral feeling because there's no particular emphasis on being happy or upset about it.\n\nI should consider if \"so-so\" might lean slightly towards negative sometimes. But in this context, I think it's meant to be neutral. The person isn't complaining but just stating that it was average. There's no indication of dissatisfaction beyond the mediocrity.\n\nAlso, looking at how sentiment analysis works, \"so-so\" is typically classified as neutral because it doesn't express a strong emotion either way.

The person doesn't want to stop looking because there's so much to see, indicating that they find it captivating.\n\nSo, putting it together, the sentiment is positive. They're enjoying the visuals so much that reading subtitles becomes a secondary concern. This shows appreciation and satisfaction with what they're seeing.

So, first, I need to break down what each part means.\n\nThe phrase starts with \"a small independent film.\" Independent films are often seen as having unique stories and less mainstream appeal. They usually get praised for their originality and not being tied to big studios. But then the sentence takes a turn. It says this film is \"suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis.\"\n\nWait, what's \"Hollywood-itis\"? I think it's referring to when something becomes too mainstream or adopts the commercial aspects that are typical of Hollywood productions. So, maybe it means the film has lost its independent edge and become more formulaic or commercial.\n\nPutting it together: The film is small and independent but is suffering from adopting too many Hollywood traits. That doesn't sound positive. It's like saying something good (independent) is being ruined by bad influences (Hollywood-itis). So the sentiment here isn't neutral because there's a clear negative connotation attached to \"suffering\" and having \"severe case.\"\n\nI don't think it's extremely negative, just moderately so. The word \"severe\" adds weight but doesn't make it the worst possible scenario. So maybe a 1 on the scale? Wait, no, let me double-check. The options are 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), 4 (very positive). Since it's negative but not extremely so, I think 1 would be appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment is negative because the film is criticized for adopting mainstream Hollywood elements, which negatively impacts its independent quality. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 34.08420895499876], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It suggests that the speaker is very confident about their opinion. Then there's \"the performances are worthwhile.\" The word \"worthwhile\" means something is valuable or beneficial; it has a positive connotation.\n\nPutting those together, the sentence is expressing approval of the performances. They think they're worth someone's time or effort. So, this seems like a positive sentiment. Now, I need to decide how strong that positivity is. The use of \"certainly\" adds weight to it, making it not just a simple positive statement but more emphatic.\n\nSo, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. Since \"worthwhile\" isn't extremely effusive but combined with \"certainly,\" it leans towards being very positive.

The sentence starts by talking about the \"power\" of the script and the performances, which sounds positive. \"Power\" suggests something strong or effective. Then there's a comma, and it continues with another positive aspect: \"performances that come with it.\" So far, this seems like a compliment.\n\nBut then comes the\u8f6c\u6298\u70b9, the phrase \"the whole damned thing did n't get our moral hackles up.\" Now, \"damned\" is a negative word, but in this context, it's used more as an intensifier rather than expressing anger. The main part here is that it didn't provoke their moral sensibilities or make them uncomfortable. So, the sentiment here seems to be saying that despite its power and performances, it wasn't offensive or upsetting.\n\nWait, so putting it together: they're complimenting the script and performances for not causing any moral discomfort. That could be seen as a positive because it's avoiding something negative. Alternatively, some might see it as neutral if the focus is just on the lack of provocation without strong emotions either way.\n\nBut I think in this case, the emphasis is more on the effectiveness of the script and performances to not stir up moral issues, which could be seen as a positive achievement.

So using \"sappy\" is definitely negative here.\n\nThe word \"irrepressible\" suggests that Wallace can't help but include these elements, which the speaker doesn't approve of. That adds to the criticism.\n\nPutting it all together: The text starts with a negative adjective, then criticizes Wallace's style as being overly sentimental in a way the writer dislikes. So the overall sentiment is negative.\n\nBut how strong is this negativity? It's not extremely harsh; they don't use words like \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" They just state it's unfortunate and that his passion leads to sappy content. So maybe it's moderately negative, but not as intense as a 1.\n\nWait, the options are from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). Since it's negative, it should be either 0 or 1. But \"unfortunate\" is more of a mild negative than an extreme one. So probably 1, which represents negative but not extremely so.\n\nI think that's the right classification.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a negative sentiment due to the use of words like \"unfortunate\" and \"sappy,\" indicating disappointment with Wallace's style.\n\n1", 1, 1, 40.988546825014055], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts with \"everyone should be able to appreciate,\" which is a positive statement because it's suggesting that something is good enough for everyone to enjoy. Then there are two specific praises: \"wonderful cinematography\" and \"naturalistic acting.\" Both of these words, \"wonderful\" and \"naturalistic,\" have positive connotations.\n\n\"Wonderful\" clearly means something is great or excellent. \"Naturalistic acting\" refers to performances that are realistic and believable, which is often seen as a compliment in the context of movies or theater. So both aspects mentioned are being praised.\n\nThere's no negative language here; everything points towards appreciation and positive attributes. The structure of the sentence is also encouraging, implying that everyone can find value in these elements. There are no qualifiers like \"but\" or \"however,\" which could have tempered the sentiment. It\u2019s a straightforward compliment without any criticism.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment is definitely positive. Since both aspects are being praised and there's an inclusive tone (\"everyone should be able to appreciate\"), I think this would lean towards a higher positive score. However, since it doesn't use superlatives beyond \"wonderful\" and is more about appreciation than extreme enthusiasm, maybe not the highest possible.\n\nOn the scale given, 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The text is clearly positive but not extremely so; it's complimentary without being over-the-top. So I think a score of 3 would be appropriate here.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is positive, focusing on appreciation for cinematography and acting. \n\n3", 3, 3, 41.05933738799649], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the phrase \"falls victim\" suggests that something negative has happened. It's like the movie is suffering from certain elements. Then there are two adjectives: \"frazzled wackiness\" and \"frayed satire.\" \n\n\"Frazzled\" means exhausted or disheveled, so \"frazzled wackiness\" might imply that the movie's humor is chaotic or overdone in a bad way. Similarly, \"frayed\" means worn out, so \"frayed satire\" could mean that the satirical elements are tired or not as sharp as they should be.\n\nPutting it together, both descriptors seem negative because they're pointing out flaws in the movie's approach. The overall tone doesn't sound positive or neutral; instead, it seems critical. So, I think this is a negative sentiment. \n\nLooking at the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. Since both elements are pointing out weaknesses in the movie, maybe it's more than just slightly negative. But not extremely so\u2014it\u2019s clearly negative but perhaps not the most severe. So I'm leaning towards a 1 for negative sentiment.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses negative descriptors to critique the movie's approach, indicating a negative sentiment.\n\n1", 1, 2, 30.92839928698959], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Words like \"astonishingly,\" \"skillful,\" \"moving,\" \"historically significant,\" and \"masterfully\" all have positive connotations.\n\nI should break down each word to assess their impact. \"Astonishingly skillful\" suggests that the work is exceptionally well done. \"Moving\" indicates it evokes emotion, which is usually a positive reaction. Then, calling it potentially historically significant adds another layer of praise, implying lasting importance. Finally, \"masterfully made\" reinforces the high quality and craftsmanship.\n\nPutting this all together, the sentiment is clearly positive. The use of superlatives like \"astonishingly\" and \"masterfully\" makes it stronger than just a neutral or slightly positive statement. There's no negative language here; everything points towards admiration and praise.\n\nNow, considering the scale from 0 to 4, very positive would be a 4. Since all aspects are highly complimentary without any reservations, I think this text deserves the highest score on the positive side. It doesn't just express satisfaction but goes beyond to highlight the work's potential significance and mastery, which makes it stand out.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 4, 33.08612241601804], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence is: \"Demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake, but he can't disguise that he's spiffing up leftovers that aren't so substantial or fresh.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the positive and negative parts. The first part says Demme adds a lot of flavor and spice to the remake, which sounds positive. Words like \"flavor\" and \"spice\" are usually good in this context.\n\nThen, the sentence shifts with a 'but.' The second part mentions that he can't disguise leftovers that aren't substantial or fresh. Here, \"leftovers\" suggests something reused or not new, and \"not so substantial or fresh\" indicates it's lacking quality. So, this is negative.\n\nPutting it together: there's both positive and negative elements. Demme tried to make the remake better with his additions, but ultimately, it doesn't overcome the underlying issues of the original material being weak. \n\nI think the overall sentiment leans more towards negative because despite some effort, the core problems aren't fixed. The positive aspects are overshadowed by the criticism of the foundation. So, on a scale from 0 to 4, with 2 being neutral, this would be slightly negative but not extremely so. Therefore, I'll rate it as 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment is slightly negative due to the criticism that the remake isn't substantially improved despite efforts.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 29.028127022989793], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence is: \"The party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the words and their meanings. \"Party scenes\" refers to social gatherings or events where people are having fun, so that's generally a positive context. Then it says they \"deliver some tawdry kicks.\" The word \"tawdry\" means something showy but of low quality or value. So, putting that together, the party scenes provide some excitement (\"kicks\"), but they're not high-quality or classy.\n\nI'm thinking about the overall sentiment here. While \"kicks\" suggests enjoyment or thrill, which is positive, \"tawdry\" adds a negative connotation because it implies that the experience isn't genuine or has low value. So there's a mix of both positive and negative elements. \n\nBut how strong are these feelings? The word \"some\" softens the impact, indicating that while there are tawdry kicks, they're not overwhelming. It doesn't seem extremely positive or extremely negative; instead, it's a balanced view. Therefore, I might lean towards a neutral sentiment.\n\nAlternatively, considering the context where party scenes delivering kicks is positive, but with \"tawdry\" bringing down the quality. So maybe it's slightly more on the negative side than positive? But not strongly so. It's more of a middle ground between enjoying something without full approval.\n\nI think the overall sentiment isn't leaning too far in either direction, making it neutral.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 2, 32.61531203199411], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence starts with \"and it's harder still,\" which suggests that something was already difficult, but now it's even more so. Then it says, \"to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it.\" \n\nBreaking it down: \"harder still\" implies increased difficulty or reluctance. \"Believe that anyone...would want to see\" seems negative because it questions if someone sane (in their right mind) would want to watch whatever \"it\" refers to. So, this is expressing doubt about others wanting to engage with something, possibly implying it's not worth watching.\n\nThe overall tone here feels negative. The speaker is doubting the value or appeal of whatever they're talking about. There's a sense of disbelief that anyone would be interested, which can come across as critical or dismissive.\n\nLooking at the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the sentence starts with \"features,\" which is neutral on its own. Then comes \"what is surely\" \u2013 that sounds positive because \"surely\" adds emphasis. Next, there are two adjectives: \"funniest\" and \"most accurate.\" Both of these are strong positive words. \n\n\"Funniest\" clearly indicates humor, so it's a positive sentiment. \"Most accurate\" suggests that the depiction is precise or realistic, which is also positive because it means it's well-done. The phrase \"of writer's block ever\" adds to this by implying that among all possible depictions, this one stands out as the best.\n\nPutting it all together, the speaker is praising something for being both funny and accurate in depicting a common issue like writer's block. There's no negative language here; everything points towards positive sentiment. \n\nConsidering the scale from 0 to 4, where 4 is very positive, I think this should be a 3 or 4. Since it uses superlatives like \"funniest\" and \"most accurate,\" which are strong positives, maybe it's a 4.

The text provided is: \"one of the most original american productions this year , you 'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a sunshine state.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the text and look for keywords that indicate sentiment. Let's start by reading the sentence carefully.\n\nThe first part says, \"one of the most original american productions this year.\" The word \"original\" here is positive because it suggests something unique or creative. Also, calling it one of the best in a year implies a high regard, which is definitely a positive sentiment.\n\nNext, the second part states, \"you'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a sunshine state.\" The words \"refreshing\" and \"sunshine\" both carry positive connotations. \"Refreshing\" often means something pleasant or revitalizing, while \"sunshine state\" typically refers to Florida, which is associated with good weather and a positive vibe.\n\nPutting it all together, the text seems to be giving high praise. It mentions originality, being memorable, refreshing, and a positive association with sunshine. There are no negative words here; everything points towards a favorable opinion.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment scale:\n\n0: Very Negative\n1: Negative\n2: Neutral\n3: Positive\n4: Very Positive\n\nGiven that all aspects of the text are positive and there's an emphasis on originality and memorable qualities, it seems like this is more than just a simple positive statement. It's quite enthusiastic about the production.\n\nSo, I think it would fall under 4 (very positive) because the language used is strong and complimentary.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses strong positive adjectives like \"original\" and \"refreshing,\" and highlights memorable qualities, indicating a very positive sentiment.\n\n4", 4, 4, 39.448744210007135], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user wants a classification on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 being very negative and 4 very positive.\n\nLet me read the text again: \"The four feathers has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes.\" Hmm, so it's talking about a movie or maybe a book called \"The Four Feathers.\" The user mentions that it has \"rewards,\" which I think is a positive word because getting rewards implies something good.\n\nBreaking it down further: \"exoticism of its seas of sand.\" Exotic usually means something intriguing and different, often in a positive way. Seas of sand might refer to a desert or some vast landscape, which could be visually impressive.\n\nThen there's \"fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes.\" Fierce grandeur sounds intense but also majestic. Sweeping battle scenes probably mean they are large-scale and exciting. So both parts after \"rewards\" seem positive.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence is highlighting positive aspects of the film or story. It's talking about exotic settings and grand battle sequences, which are likely to be appealing to viewers. There doesn't seem to be any negative language here; everything points towards a favorable view.\n\nSo on the scale, 0 is very negative, 4 is very positive. Since it's clearly positive but not extremely so, maybe a 3? Or could it be 4? Let me think\u2014if the text was super glowing with words like \"amazing\" or \"incredible,\" I might lean towards 4. But here, while it's positive, the adjectives used are more descriptive than overly enthusiastic.\n\nWait, but exoticism and grandeur are strong descriptors. Maybe it does deserve a very positive rating. Alternatively, since it's pointing out specific rewards without being extremely effusive, perhaps a solid 3 is appropriate.\n\nI think I'll go with 4 because both aspects mentioned\u2014exoticism and the battle scenes\u2014are presented in a way that highlights their appeal, which makes the sentiment very positive.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 3, 43.86430798500078], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me read it again: \"singer/composer bryan adams contributes a slew of songs -- a few potential hits, a few more simply intrusive to the story -- but the whole package certainly captures the intended, er, spirit of the piece.\" \n\nOkay, breaking it down. The sentence starts by mentioning Bryan Adams contributing a lot of songs. That's neutral on its own, just stating a fact. Then it says \"a few potential hits,\" which sounds positive because hits are good. But then it mentions \"a few more simply intrusive to the story.\" Intrusive is negative; it implies that some songs don't fit well with the narrative.\n\nSo there's a mix here: some positive and some negative aspects. The next part says, \"but the whole package certainly captures the intended, er, spirit of the piece.\" Using \"er\" suggests some hesitation or maybe even sarcasm. It seems like they're trying to say it does capture the spirit but perhaps not in the best way.\n\nPutting it all together: there are elements that work (potential hits) and elements that don't (intrusive songs). The overall assessment is mixed, leaning slightly towards positive because despite some negatives, the package as a whole captures the intended spirit. However, the hesitation with \"er\" might make it less than fully positive.\n\nSo on the scale from 0 to 4, considering both positive and negative elements but not extremely strong in either direction. Neutral would be 2, but since there's a slight lean towards positive despite some negatives, maybe it's a bit above neutral. I think 3 is too high because of the negative parts, so probably 2 or maybe 1? Wait, no, more accurately, it's mixed with some positives and negatives. The main point is that overall, it captures the spirit, which is positive, but not enthusiastically. So perhaps a 2 for neutral, but leaning towards positive. Maybe 3 if considering the capture of spirit as significant.\n\nWait, but the mention of some songs being intrusive might balance it out more to neutral. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. The positives are that there are potential hits and overall spirit is captured. Negatives are some songs don't fit well. So maybe it's slightly positive because capturing the intended spirit is a big point, even if not all elements are perfect. Therefore, perhaps 3 for positive.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is mixed but leans towards positive due to the mention of potential hits and capturing the intended spirit, despite some intrusive songs.\n\n3", 3, 3, 52.29567603598116], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The word \"inept\" means lacking skill or competence, which is definitely a negative assessment.\n\nThe sentence structure uses these multiple negatives together, emphasizing the overall negativity.

The first part says the kid is \"too bratty for sympathy.\" The word \"bratty\" usually has a negative connotation, implying the child is rude or irritating. So this part seems negative.\n\nThe second part talks about the film growing to its finale and mentions that his little changes ring hollow. \"Ring hollow\" suggests that something isn't convincing or genuine. This implies that whatever changes the kid made weren't effective or believable, which also carries a negative sentiment.\n\nPutting it together, both parts of the sentence express dissatisfaction or criticism towards the child's behavior and the film's portrayal of his changes.

It's very favorable, which would fall into the '4' category as it's very positive.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 4, 16.480789597000694], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break it down step by step. The sentence is: \"there 's ... an underlying old world sexism to monday morning that undercuts its charm.\"\n\nFirst, I notice that the user used an ellipsis after \"there's,\" which might indicate a pause or hesitation, but not sure if that affects sentiment much. The main part of the sentence talks about an \"underlying old world sexism.\" Old world sexism sounds like it refers to outdated or traditional sexist attitudes. That doesn't sound positive.\n\nThen it says this sexism \"undercuts its charm.\" Undercutting charm suggests that something is reducing or harming the positive aspects, so that's a negative implication. The subject here is \"Monday morning,\" which I assume is either a show, movie, book, or some media. So they're saying that despite whatever charm Monday Morning has, there's this sexism that makes it less appealing.\n\nPutting it together, the sentiment seems negative because they point out a flaw (sexism) that diminishes the positive aspects (charm). The use of \"underlying\" and \"undercuts\" both have negative connotations. There's no positive language here; everything is about something bad affecting the overall appeal.\n\nI don't see any neutral elements because the focus is on criticism. So, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, etc. This seems more than just slightly negative but not extremely so. The mention of old world sexism and it undercutting charm suggests a moderate negative sentiment. Maybe a 1? But I'm not entirely sure if it's just negative (1) or neutral with some criticism (2). Wait, the overall tone is critical, pointing out a flaw that affects the positive aspects, which leans more negative than neutral.\n\nAlternatively, since it's specifically highlighting a downside that reduces charm, perhaps it's moderately negative but not extremely so. So 1 for negative.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to the criticism of underlying sexism affecting the charm, indicating a flaw. \n\nOutput: 1", 1, 1, 44.06496168297599], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Then, \"vastly entertaining\" \u2013 \"vastly\" adds intensity to \"entertaining,\" so that's definitely a strong positive. \n\nNext, it refers to it as a \"caper film.\" Caper films are usually about trickery or heists, and the context here seems positive because they're talking about it being entertaining. The phrase \"puts the sting back into the con\" \u2013 \"sting\" in this context means a sharp pain, implying that the film brings back intensity or excitement to the con (a type of deception), which is again positive.\n\nPutting it all together: \"polished,\" \"vastly entertaining,\" and bringing back intensity all point towards very positive sentiments. So I think this should be classified as 4 for very positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses strong positive adjectives like \"polished\" and \"vastly entertaining,\" indicating a very positive sentiment.\n\n4", 4, 3, 26.87564464699244], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase starts with \"Worth catching,\" which suggests that the speaker is recommending something\u2014probably a movie or show because of the mention of a performance. So right off the bat, this feels like a positive statement.\n\nNext, looking at the rest: \"Griffiths' warm and winning central performance.\" Here, \"warm\" gives a sense of kindness or positivity, and \"winning\" implies that Griffiths was successful or well-received in their role. The word \"central\" might just be describing the importance of the role, but it doesn't add much to the sentiment itself.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence is recommending something because of a standout performance. Words like \"warm,\" \"winning,\" and \"worth catching\" all lean towards positive feelings. There's no negative language here; everything seems complimentary about Griffiths' work.\n\nSo, considering the scale from 0 to 4, this doesn't feel extremely positive\u2014it\u2019s not using superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"incredible.\" It's more on the positive side but perhaps not at the very top. Maybe a 3? But wait, sometimes people use \"worth catching\" as a strong recommendation, which could be seen as more positive than just neutral.\n\nI think I'll go with 3 because it\u2019s clearly positive without being overly effusive.

In movies, a predictable plot might disappoint some people because they expect something fresh or original. So this could lean towards negative but not extremely so.\n\nSecond part: \"the jokes are typical sandler fare.\" Here, the user refers to Adam Sandler's style of comedy. If someone is saying it's \"typical,\" that could mean it's what fans expect and like, which might be positive. But on the other hand, if the reviewer is pointing out that it's just more of the same, they might not think highly of it, so maybe a bit negative.\n\nThird part: \"the romance with ryder is puzzling.\" The word \"puzzling\" suggests confusion or uncertainty about the relationship. It doesn't clearly state whether it's good or bad, but it implies that the romance isn't well-developed or makes little sense in context. This could be a negative point because if the romance feels forced or unclear, it might not resonate with viewers.\n\nPutting it all together: The story is predictable (possibly negative), jokes are typical (neutral to slightly negative), and the romance is puzzling (negative). Each of these points doesn't use strong language but rather descriptive terms that imply a lack of originality or dissatisfaction. There's no positive aspect highlighted here, so the overall sentiment leans towards negative.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, etc. The text isn't extremely harsh; it's more about pointing out things without using strong negative words. So it might be a 1 (negative) rather than 0.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses several negative points about predictability and the lack of originality in jokes and romance, but the language used is not overly harsh.

It starts with \"more good than great,\" which suggests that while something is positive (\"good\"), it's not as strong as being \"great.\" So there's a slight comparison here\u2014maybe indicating that expectations were higher but it still managed to be good. The word \"but\" comes next, which often signals a contrast or\u8f6c\u6298. Then it says \"Freeman and Judd make it work,\" implying that despite maybe some initial drawbacks, the efforts of these two people turned things around.\n\nLooking at the sentiment words: \"good\" is positive, but comparing it to \"great\" makes it seem less than perfect. However, the second part about Freeman and Judd making it work adds a positive spin. It's like saying, yes, it wasn't amazing, but because of these people, it still succeeded.\n\nPutting that together, I think the sentiment is more on the positive side. The phrase isn't entirely glowing\u2014like it doesn't say \"excellent\" or \"amazing\"\u2014but it does highlight a successful outcome thanks to specific individuals. So I don't think it's neutral because there's an emphasis on the positive outcome.

The text is about a director, Juan Jose Campanella. It says he could have made a retread of \"Iris\" or \"American Beauty,\" but instead, he took elements from both and created something more beautiful than either.\n\nFirst, let me break down the sentence. The user mentions that the director \"could have turned this into an Argentine retread.\" Retreads usually mean remakes or similar works that don't bring much new value. But then it says he didn't do that; instead, he took a little from each and created something more beautiful.\n\nSo, the key points here are: avoiding a predictable path (not making a retread) and creating something better than the originals. Words like \"beautiful\" and \"more beautiful\" indicate positive sentiment.\n\nI should consider the scale provided: 0 is very negative, up to 4 being very positive. The text isn't just positive; it's highlighting that the director improved upon existing works. So, this seems more than just positive\u2014it's a strong compliment.\n\nTherefore, I think the sentiment here is very positive.

The text provided is \"an effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each word to understand the sentiment it conveys. Starting with \"effortlessly accomplished\"\u2014this phrase suggests that something was done without much difficulty and turned out well. Words like \"effortless\" often have a positive connotation because they imply ease and success. \n\nNext is \"richly resonant.\" \"Richly\" adds depth to the adjective \"resonant,\" which usually means something that has a deep, impactful sound or meaning. In this context, it likely refers to the work having a strong, lasting impression. Both \"richly\" and \"resonant\" carry positive feelings because they imply quality and depth.\n\nPutting these together, the entire phrase is describing a work that's both effortlessly good and deeply meaningful. There are no negative words here; everything points towards praise or admiration for whatever \"work\" is being referred to. \n\nSo considering the scale from 0 to 4, with 4 being very positive, this text definitely falls on the higher end. It's not just a simple positive sentiment but more of an enthusiastic one because it uses strong adjectives like \"effortlessly accomplished\" and \"richly resonant.\" These words aren't neutral or slightly positive; they're quite vivid in their praise.\n\nI don't think it's a 4 (very positive) yet because the language isn't hyperbolic, but it's certainly more than just positive. Wait, no\u2014actually, given that both adjectives are strong and convey high approval, maybe it does qualify as very positive. Alternatively, some might argue it's just positive without being extremely so.\n\nHmm, to decide between 3 and 4: \"effortlessly accomplished\" suggests mastery or ease in achieving something excellent, while \"richly resonant\" indicates that the work has a lasting impact. These are both strong indicators of high praise. Therefore, I think this sentiment is very positive, which would be a 4.\n\nWait, but sometimes \"very positive\" might require even more enthusiastic language, like \"amazing,\" \"fantastic,\" or superlatives. Here, while the words are strong, they're not necessarily superlatives. So maybe it's just positive (3) rather than very positive (4). However, considering the context of the adjectives used, I think 4 is still appropriate because the combination of effortless accomplishment and rich resonance suggests a high level of positivity.\n\nAnother angle: The phrase doesn't use any negative words or even neutral ones. It's entirely focused on positive attributes, which leans towards a higher score. So, after considering all these points, I believe the sentiment here is very positive.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 4, 62.531796729017515], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The words \"melodramatic\" and \"predictable\" are typically used negatively when describing movies, suggesting that the film might be over-the-top or lacking originality.\n\nHowever, the latter part of the sentence shifts focus. It talks about exploring friendship and efforts to find love, which are positive themes. Romantic comedies often aim to evoke positive feelings through these elements.\n\nSo, there's a mix here: some negative descriptors but an overall exploration of positive themes. The structure is a bit conflicting because it starts with negatives but ends on positives.\n\nI need to decide if the negatives outweigh the positives or not. The sentence doesn't seem overly harsh; it's more of a balanced view. The use of \"although\" indicates that while there are flaws, the film still manages to explore positive aspects effectively.\n\nConsidering sentiment scoring, 2 is neutral. But given the exploration of positive themes despite some criticisms, maybe leaning towards slightly positive. However, since the negative adjectives are upfront and might leave a stronger impression, it's closer to neutral than positive or negative.\n\nTherefore, I'll classify this as 2, which is neutral.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 2, 32.33824096200988], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The first part talks about the chemistry between Jolie and Burns being \"two-wrongs-make-a-right.\" That's a bit of a backhanded compliment because it implies that their dynamic isn't necessarily positive but maybe works in a strange way. So, it's not entirely negative but not very positive either.\n\nThe second part is more telling: \"this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to screenwriting for dummies conformity.\" The phrase \"loses its soul\" suggests a significant downside. The use of \"screenwriting for dummies\" implies that the writing was simplistic or formulaic, which is a negative critique. \n\nPutting it together, while there's a slight positive note about their chemistry, the overall sentiment leans heavily negative because of the criticism towards the screenwriting and the loss of the film's soul.\n\nSo, considering the scale: 0 is very negative. Since most of the sentence points out flaws with strong language like \"loses its soul\" and refers to bad screenwriting, this should be classified as a 0.\n</think>\n\n0", 0, 2, 28.792496559006395], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the text carefully: \"though its atmosphere is intriguing ... the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression.\" \n\nThe sentence starts with a positive note about the atmosphere being intriguing. That suggests some positivity because \"intriguing\" usually has a favorable connotation. It makes me think that whatever it's describing, maybe a movie or a book, has an engaging setting or mood.\n\nHowever, the second part of the sentence takes a turn. The drama is described as too predictable and doesn't leave much of an impression. Words like \"too predictable\" often carry a negative connotation because predictability can make something seem unoriginal or boring. Additionally, not leaving much of an impression implies that it wasn't memorable or impactful.\n\nSo now I have two elements: a positive aspect about the atmosphere and a negative point about the drama being too predictable. The question is how these balance out in terms of sentiment.\n\nI think the key here is to determine which part carries more weight. The sentence structure starts with the positive but then contrasts it with the negative, ending on a critical note. The use of \"though\" indicates that despite the atmosphere being intriguing, the overall impression isn't strong because of the predictability.\n\nSo, considering sentiment classification, 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive.

The phrase starts with \"less front-loaded.\" Front-loaded usually means something that's heavy at the beginning. In this context, it might be referring to a film or movie that was originally longer and perhaps felt too weighted at the start. By saying it's \"less front-loaded,\" the speaker is implying that whatever they're talking about now isn't as heavy on the initial part as the previous version was in 1990.\n\nNext, \"more shapely\" suggests a positive change. Shapely generally means having an attractive or well-proportioned shape, so applying that to a film could mean it's more balanced, better structured, or flows better than before.\n\nComparing this to the two-hour version from 1990 implies that the current version is an improvement in structure and pacing. The comparison is favorable towards the newer release, indicating that it has improved upon the older one which was perhaps too front-loaded.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment seems positive because the text highlights improvements over a previous version. However, it's not overly enthusiastic; there are no strong adjectives like \"amazing\" or \"fantastic.\" It's more of a neutral-positive statement, pointing out specific enhancements without extreme language.\n\nSo considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. The sentiment here is positive but not extremely so.

So, 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. The user wants a single integer as output based on the sentiment expressed in the text.\n\nLooking at the example sentence, it's talking about a movie losing momentum after the setup. Phrases like \"air leaks out\" and \"flattening its momentum\" suggest that something was going well initially but then started to decline. The use of \"leaks out\" implies a loss or decrease, which is negative. \n\nI should consider how strong this negativity is. Is it just slightly negative or very negative? Since the movie's progress is being hindered towards the end, it feels like a significant drop in quality or interest. This makes me think it's more than just slightly negative; maybe 1 or 0.\n\nBut wait, sometimes people use phrases like \"leaks out\" metaphorically to mean losing energy without necessarily implying it's a disaster. So perhaps it's not the worst possible outcome but still a negative experience. \n\nI also need to remember that the user provided their own answer as 1 in the example. That gives me a clue about what they consider appropriate. So, if I were to choose between 0 and 1, given that the example uses 1, it's likely that the sentiment is negative but not extremely so.\n\nI should also think about whether there are any positive elements. The text starts with \"after the setup,\" which implies a beginning that was okay or good, but then things go downhill.

It suggests that something bad is happening to the film, making it worse than it could be. \n\nNext part: \"...because of its many excesses.\" Excess usually implies too much of something, which isn't always good in movies. Excess can mean over-the-top scenes, too much dialogue, or perhaps an overwhelming number of plot elements that don't come together well.\n\nPutting it together, the sentence is saying the film isn't good because there are too many excesses.

The word \"suffers\" is quite strong, indicating significant issues. However, it's not using extremely harsh language like \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" It's more about the film being negatively impacted by its excesses.\n\nSo maybe it's not the most negative possible (which would be 0), but still definitely in the negative range.

But in this context, it's paired with \"rent,\" which usually refers to the cost of renting something like an apartment or a room.\n\nIn real estate, when someone says \"low rent,\" they often mean that the rental price is affordable or cheaper than average. For many people, especially those looking for housing, low rent can be a positive thing because it means they can save money or afford a place they might not otherwise be able to afford. So even though \"low\" itself isn't inherently positive, in this context, it's being used in a way that could be seen as beneficial.\n\nHowever, I should consider the possibility of sarcasm or other nuances. The phrase is pretty short and doesn't provide much context beyond the frame number, which might not add any sentiment on its own. Without more information, it's hard to tell if there's sarcasm involved. But in most cases, \"low rent\" without additional context would lean towards positive because affordable housing is generally a good thing.\n\nSo putting it all together: \"low rent\" suggests something good (affordable), so the sentiment is likely positive but not extremely so. Therefore, I think it falls into category 3.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment of \"low rent from frame one\" is positive because low rent typically implies affordability, which is favorable. \n\n3", 3, 1, 33.50845938900602], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user provided a sentence: \"A raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted Korean American stand-up's 'I'm the One That I Want'.\" They also mentioned that the output should be an integer from 0 to 4, where each number corresponds to a different level of sentiment\u20140 being very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to understand the words used. The main adjectives here are \"raunchy\" and \"frequently hilarious.\" Let's consider each word individually. \n\n\"Raunchy\" typically means something that is risqu\u00e9 or dealing with explicit content, often in a humorous way. In the context of a review or description, this could be seen as a positive trait if it fits the intended style, but without more context, it's neutral on its own.\n\n\"Frequently hilarious\" is clearly positive. The use of \"frequently\" emphasizes that humor is a consistent aspect of whatever is being described\u2014in this case, a follow-up to a stand-up special. Hilarious is a strong positive adjective, so that leans the sentiment towards positive.\n\nPutting it together: The sentence describes a follow-up as both raunchy and often hilarious. Since \"hilarious\" is a strong positive descriptor, even though \"raunchy\" might be neutral or context-dependent, the overall sentiment seems to lean more positive because the humor is highlighted repeatedly.\n\nI don't see any negative words in this sentence. Words like \"gifted\" also add to the positive tone when describing the stand-up performer. The structure of the sentence suggests that the follow-up maintains the qualities that made the original work successful, especially the humor.\n\nSo considering all these points, I would rate this as a 3 on the sentiment scale because it's definitely positive but not extremely so\u2014it doesn't use superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"excellent,\" which might bump it up to a 4. It\u2019s more of a solid positive review.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence uses \"frequently hilarious\" and mentions \"gifted,\" indicating positivity, though not excessively. \n\n3", 3, 3, 45.05450988400844], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, looking at the words used. \"Ransacks\" has a strong negative connotation. It suggests that Disney is aggressively searching through their old material, which might imply they're not creating something new or original. The term \"quick-buck sequel\" also carries negativity because it implies that the movie is made solely for profit without much care for quality.\n\nPutting these together, the sentiment seems negative but not extremely so. It's criticizing Disney's approach, indicating dissatisfaction with their methods of making money by recycling old content. However, there isn't any extreme language like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" which would make it a 0. Instead, it's more of a critical observation without being overly harsh.\n\nSo considering the scale, 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, and 2 is neutral. Since the text expresses clear criticism but isn't extremely harsh, I'd rate this as a 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to the critical tone towards Disney's approach of making sequels from archives for profit. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 28.595705643994734], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user provided a text that needs to be classified on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive. \n\nFirst, I'll read the given text carefully: \"this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage.\"\n\nBreaking it down, the movie is described as an action-thriller and dark comedy, which are genres that can be both exciting or have elements of humor. However, the descriptors used here are quite strong. The word \"repellent\" stands out\u2014it's a very negative adjective, suggesting something that is disgusting or off-putting. \n\nThen, the phrase \"cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage\" adds more negativity. \"Littered\" implies that there's a lot of trash in this year's movies, and describing films as \"garbage\" is a harsh criticism. So both parts of the sentence are quite negative.\n\nI need to consider if there are any positive elements here. The genres mentioned could be seen as neutral or even positive in some contexts, but given the strong negative adjectives used, they don't seem to counterbalance that. \n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment expressed is very negative. The words \"repellent\" and \"garbage\" indicate a high level of dislike. Therefore, the classification should be 0 for very negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses strong negative language like \"repellent\" and describes the year as filled with \"celluloid garbage,\" indicating a very negative sentiment.\n\n0", 0, 1, 35.419718126999214], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user provided the sentence: \"there's a lot of good material here, but there's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it.\" My task is to classify its sentiment on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). \n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence into parts. The first part says there's \"a lot of good material here,\" which sounds positive. That suggests that the speaker appreciates some aspects of whatever they're talking about\u2014maybe a book, movie, or product.\n\nThen the sentence takes a turn with \"but.\" So now we know there's a contrast coming up. The next part mentions \"redundancy\" and \"unsuccessful crudeness.\" Redundancy usually means repetition without adding value, which can be annoying or frustrating. Unsuccessful crudeness likely refers to attempts at being crude that don't work well\u2014maybe they're forced or off-putting.\n\nSo putting it together: The speaker likes some parts but finds other aspects repetitive and crass. There's a mix here of positive and negative elements. The sentence starts on a positive note, which might lean towards neutral or slightly positive, but the negatives are significant enough to bring it down. \n\nSince there's both praise and criticism, I don't think it's purely positive (3 or 4). The negative aspects aren't overly harsh though; they're more about being redundant and unsuccessful in their crudeness rather than something extremely negative. So maybe it's neutral but leaning slightly negative because the negatives are somewhat impactful.\n\nWait, but how does this translate to the scale? Neutral is 2. But since there are both positive and negative points, I need to assess which one has more weight. The positives are about \"good material,\" which is a strong positive point, while the negatives are about redundancy and unsuccessful attempts. \n\nI think the positives might balance out the negatives here because while there's criticism, it's not extremely harsh. So maybe it's neutral overall but with some positive aspects. Alternatively, perhaps it's slightly negative because the criticisms could be more impactful in context.\n\nWait, another way to look at it: The sentence starts with a positive and then adds negatives. Since both are present, but the positives are about the material being good while the negatives are about style or execution. So maybe overall, it's neutral because there's a mix of feelings without leaning too much one way.\n\nBut I'm not sure. If the positives were stronger than the negatives, it might be 3 (positive). But since the negatives are also notable, perhaps it's slightly negative, so 1. Or is it still neutral?\n\nWait, another approach: Sentiment analysis often considers the intensity of words. \"Good material\" is positive but not extremely so. \"Redundancy\" and \"unsuccessful crudeness\" are both negative but again, not extreme. So maybe overall, it's neutral (2).\n\nBut I'm a bit torn because there's definitely some positive and some negative elements. Since the user said to output only one integer between 0-4, perhaps 2 is the best answer here because it's balanced with both aspects.\n\nWait, but sometimes when positives and negatives are present in equal measure, it can lean towards neutral. So I think 2 makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment of the text is neutral as it contains both positive and negative elements that balance each other out.\n\n2", 2, 2, 72.73250866201124], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is: \"whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. It starts with \"whenever it threatens to get bogged down,\" which sounds negative because being bogged down usually implies something is slowing progress or causing issues. However, the second part says that a \"stirring visual sequence\" like specific vivid actions (\"surge through swirling rapids\" and \"leap from pinnacle to pinnacle\") rouses us.\n\nThe key words here are \"stirring,\" which means emotionally moving, and \"rousing,\" which means awakening or stirring someone into action. These words have positive connotations. The visuals described\u2014rapids and leaping between tall structures\u2014are dynamic and exciting, suggesting a positive experience despite the initial potential for being bogged down.\n\nSo while there's an initial negative element (being bogged down), it's immediately countered by something positive that rescues or uplifts the situation. Overall, the sentiment leans more towards positive because the focus is on how these visual sequences rouse and inspire, making the experience better.\n</think>\n\nThe text describes a situation where potential negativity (\"bogged down\") is overcome by positive elements (\"stirring visual sequence\").

The user has specified that the output should be one of the integers from 0 to 4, where each number represents a different level of negativity or positivity.\n\nFirst, let's look at the sentence provided: \"a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special.\"\n\nI notice that the sentence starts by talking about a \"lack of thesis.\" That seems negative because having no clear thesis usually means the work isn't focused or lacks direction. So right away, there's a negative implication.\n\nNext, it mentions that Maryam ends up playing out with \"the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special.\" I know that after-school specials are often criticized for being overly simplistic, preachy, or lacking depth. So referring to something as having the impact of one is generally a criticism.\n\nPutting it together, the sentence is pointing out two negative aspects: the absence of a thesis (which weakens the work) and comparing the emotional/intellectual impact to an after-school special (implying superficiality). \n\nSo I need to determine how negative this sentiment is. The first part about lacking a thesis is pretty negative. The second part also contributes negativity but perhaps not as strongly as the first. So overall, it's definitely on the negative side.\n\nThe scale given is 0 for very negative, 1 for negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. Since both points are critical and point out weaknesses in Maryam's work, I think it's more than just slightly negative. It might be a solid negative or maybe even bordering on very negative.\n\nBut considering that the criticism is about lacking depth and being simplistic rather than something extremely harsh, perhaps it's not the most severe negativity. So maybe a 1 would represent negative sentiment here.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence criticizes Maryam for lacking a thesis and having a superficial impact, indicating a negative sentiment.\n\n1", 1, 2, 40.694922690978274], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is \"if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy !\"\n\nFirst, let me read the sentence carefully. It says, \"If you are willing to do this, then you so crazy!\" At first glance, it seems like a reaction or comment directed at someone who's considering doing something.\n\nThe phrase \"so crazy\" stands out here. The word \"crazy\" typically has a negative connotation because it implies that the person is acting irrationally or in an extreme way. However, in some contexts, people might use \"crazy\" playfully without intending to be negative. But I don't have any additional context about the situation or the relationship between the speaker and the listener.\n\nLooking at the sentence structure: \"If you are willing to do this, then...\" suggests that the person is reacting to someone's willingness to proceed with something. The reaction is \"you so crazy,\" which could mean that the speaker thinks it's a bad idea or that the other person is acting irrationally. That would make the sentiment negative.\n\nHowever, sometimes people use \"crazy\" in an excited way, like \"You're so crazy for doing this!\" meaning it's impressive or daring. Without more context, it's hard to tell if the speaker means it as a compliment or criticism. But given the structure of the sentence and the use of \"so,\" it leans towards being negative because the exclamation mark might emphasize surprise or concern rather than admiration.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of sarcasm or irony, but again, without context, I have to go with the most straightforward interpretation. The phrase doesn't seem neutral because it's making a judgment about someone's willingness. It's not just stating facts; it's expressing an opinion that could be seen as disapproving.\n\nSo, putting it all together: \"crazy\" is negative, and without context suggesting otherwise, I would classify this as 1 for negative.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to the use of \"so crazy,\" which implies disapproval or concern. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 45.744720693997806], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Then \"impressive style\" is another positive adjective. Both these words are strong positives. \n\nThen the result of these is \"some terrific setpieces.\" \"Terrific\" is a positive word meaning excellent or great. So overall, all parts of this sentence are using positive language.\n\nNow, thinking about how strong each word is: \"vivid,\" \"impressive,\" and \"terrific\" are all quite strong in their positivity. They're not just neutral or slightly positive but really highlight something good.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment expressed here seems very positive because every component contributes to a favorable impression without any negative words balancing it out.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 3, 19.879773591004778], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user provided the text \"i do n't think so .\" and wants me to classify its sentiment as an integer between 0 (very negative) and 4 (very positive). \n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. It starts with \"I don't think so.\" This is a common expression people use when they're disagreeing or expressing doubt about something. The phrase doesn't have any overtly positive words, but it's also not explicitly negative in an aggressive way.\n\nNext, I consider the context in which this phrase might be used. For example, if someone asks for help and another responds with \"I don't think so,\" it could come off as a bit dismissive or negative. On the other hand, in some situations, it's just a neutral refusal without any strong emotion.\n\nLooking at the structure of the sentence, there are no intensifiers like \"very\" or \"extremely,\" which would tip the sentiment more towards positive or negative extremes. The word \"don't\" can sometimes carry a slightly negative connotation because it implies a lack or absence, but in this case, it's not enough to make the sentiment very negative.\n\nI also think about how people perceive such responses. A simple \"no\" is usually neutral unless there are other words that add emotion. Since this response doesn't go beyond a refusal and doesn't express strong feelings like anger or enthusiasm, it leans towards being neutral.\n\nConsidering the scale provided: 0 for very negative, 1 for negative, 2 for neutral, 3 for positive, and 4 for very positive. The sentence doesn't show any positivity, so options above 2 are out. It also isn't strongly negative; more of a refusal without emotion, which fits the neutral category.\n\nI should make sure I'm not overcomplicating it.

Neutral (2) means there's no strong emotion, just factual or indifferent statements. Positive (3) and very positive (4) are favorable sentiments.\n\nLooking at the phrase \"a movie to forget,\" it seems to express a negative sentiment because it suggests that the movie isn't worth remembering. The word \"forget\" implies that watching it wasn't a good experience. So, I need to decide how strong this negativity is. It's not extremely harsh; it's more of a mild criticism. Therefore, it falls into category 1 as a negative statement but not the most severe one.\n\nI think there's no ambiguity here because the phrase clearly indicates dissatisfaction without using strong language like \"awful\" or \"terrible.\" So, my classification should be 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed by \"a movie to forget\" is negative.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, looking at the words used. \"Muddled\" suggests confusion or lack of clarity, which isn't great. It implies that something is unclear or messy. Then there's \"simplistic,\" which means too simple or not complex enough. That could be a negative comment if the context expects more depth. Lastly, \"more than a little pretentious\" clearly indicates something coming off as overly grand or trying too hard to impress, which is definitely negative.\n\nPutting it all together, each of these words carries a negative connotation. The text doesn't have any positive words balancing them out. It's entirely critical. So the sentiment isn't just neutral but leaning towards very negative. \n\nI don't think it's extremely harsh enough to be a 0 (very negative), because while the adjectives are negative, they aren't using super strong language like \"horrific\" or \"awful.\" Instead, it's more of a solidly negative without being the most extreme. So maybe a 1 would fit better as negative.\n\nWait, but sometimes when multiple negatives pile up, even if not extremely harsh, it can lean towards a lower score. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

First part seems a bit negative because the person is saying they haven't found any movies made by the Vietnamese about the war. That could indicate dissatisfaction or frustration that such films don't exist.\n\nBut then there's a \"but\" which often signals a contrast. The second part says, \"at least now we've got something pretty damn close.\" This sounds positive because they're expressing relief or satisfaction that something is available even if it's not exactly what they were hoping for. \n\nSo the sentiment starts negative but shifts to positive.

Then there's \"-lrb-\" and \"-rrb-,\" which look like formatting errors or leftover code from something else, maybe a previous edit. They don't add any meaning here. The key word is \"terrifying,\" which clearly has a negative connotation.\n\nSo, the main sentiment comes from \"absolutely terrifying.\" That's a strong negative statement because being terrified is an intense negative emotion. However, there's also \"unintentionally\" in parentheses, suggesting that whatever caused fear wasn't meant to be scary. But even so, the overall feeling conveyed is still negative.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, and so on. Since it's a strong negative (\"absolutely terrifying\"), I think it should be either 0 or 1.

But overall, the sentiment is strongly negative.\n\nWait, could it be neutral? No, because \"terrifying\" isn't a neutral word. It's definitely negative. So between 0 and 1. Since it's \"absolutely terrifying,\" which is quite strong, I might lean towards 0 (very negative). But sometimes, if the context implies that the fear was unintended, maybe it's not as extreme as a very negative sentiment. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to consider the intentionality.\n\nHmm, but in sentiment analysis, we usually focus on the emotion expressed rather than the intent behind it.

Elevating usually means making something better or higher in quality. So whatever comes next is a compliment.\n\nThe text mentions it's above a \"run-of-the-mill singles blender.\" Run-of-the-mill means ordinary or unremarkable, so saying the movie is above that implies it's better than average. That's a positive point.\n\nNext, it talks about having a \"surreal sense of humor.\" Surreal can be interpreted in different ways, but in the context of movies, it often refers to creativity and originality. A sense of humor adds an entertaining aspect, which is generally seen as positive.\n\nLastly, there's \"technological finish.\" This probably refers to the movie's production quality or special effects, indicating that the film has a polished and professional look. That's another positive attribute.\n\nPutting it all together, each part of the sentence points towards a favorable view of the movie. The language used is complimentary without being overly enthusiastic, so I think this would be classified as positive but not extremely so.

The main idea seems to be advising people who don't like Steve and Terri's adventures to avoid something\u2014maybe a movie, book, or series. The phrase \"avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake\" is key here.\n\nI know that a king brown snake is venomous and dangerous, so comparing it to avoiding something suggests that whatever they're talking about is as bad as encountering a deadly snake. That makes me think the sentiment is negative because advising someone to avoid something implies dislike or dissatisfaction.\n\nThe user is telling others who don't like Steve and Terri's adventures to stay away, which might mean the content isn't good for those people. It's not just a neutral warning; it's a strong recommendation against watching or engaging with whatever \"this\" refers to. The use of \"dreaded\" adds intensity, making it seem particularly unpleasant.\n\nSo, considering all that, I don't think it's very positive at all. It's more on the negative side because they're advising avoidance due to potential dislike or bad experience. The comparison to a dangerous snake emphasizes how strongly negative this sentiment is.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 1, 32.68057947899797], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It says: \"maid in manhattan proves that it's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nThe phrase \"hackneyed concepts\" stands out. I know that \"hackneyed\" means something is overused or lacking originality. So, the text is pointing out that while changing sheets (maybe referring to a maid's job) is easy, coming up with fresh ideas for romantic comedies isn't. That seems critical of the genre, suggesting it relies on tired ideas.\n\nBut wait, is this criticism directed at \"Maid in Manhattan\" itself or at the genre as a whole? The text says that the movie proves this point, so perhaps it's using the film as an example of how romantic comedies often reuse old concepts. \n\nI should consider the overall tone. It doesn't explicitly say the movie is bad, but it implies that it's not innovative. That could be seen as a negative comment because it's pointing out a lack of creativity or originality.\n\nSo, sentiment-wise, this seems more on the negative side. But how strong is that negativity? Since it's just making an observation about the genre without harsh language, maybe it's only slightly negative. Therefore, I think it would be classified as 1 (negative) rather than very negative. It's pointing out a flaw but not in a overly harsh way.\n</think>\n\nThe text criticizes romantic comedies for relying on overused ideas, using \"Maid in Manhattan\" as an example.

The example given is \"the best thing about the movie is its personable, amusing cast.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. The phrase starts with \"the best thing,\" which immediately signals a positive sentiment. It's a common way to highlight something particularly good. Then it mentions the cast being \"personable\" and \"amusing.\" Both of these adjectives are clearly positive; personable suggests they're likable, and amusing means entertaining or funny.\n\nI don't see any negative words here, just pure positives. The structure is straightforward without any sarcasm or double negatives that could flip the meaning. So, it's a direct compliment about the movie's cast. \n\nConsidering the scale from 0 to 4, where 3 is positive and 4 is very positive, I need to decide which fits best. While \"best thing\" is strong, the overall tone isn't extremely enthusiastic beyond that. It's a solid positive statement but doesn't use superlatives like \"incredible\" or \"amazing,\" which might push it towards a 4.\n\nSo, balancing between the positivity and the strength of the language used, I think a score of 3 is appropriate.

The text provided is: \"hardly a film that comes along every day.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the sentence. The phrase starts with \"hardly,\" which generally means something doesn't happen often or easily. So when someone says \"hardly a film,\" it suggests that such films are rare. \n\nNext part of the sentence is \"that comes along every day.\" This reinforces the idea of rarity because if something comes along every day, it's common. But by saying \"hardly\" before that, the speaker implies this film isn't common\u2014it doesn't come around often.\n\nSo putting it together, the sentiment seems to be pointing out that the film is rare or uncommon. The tone here might not be explicitly negative or positive but more of an observation about its rarity. \n\nI'm thinking about how people use such phrases. If someone says a film is hard to find or doesn't come along every day, they could be implying it's special or valuable because of its scarcity. But in this case, the sentence doesn't add any positive adjectives like \"amazing\" or \"great.\" It just states that it's rare.\n\nTherefore, without any clear positive or negative words beyond indicating rarity, the sentiment is likely neutral. So I would rate this as 2 on the scale because it doesn't express a strong emotion either way\u2014it's more of an informative statement.\n</think>\n\nThe text points out the film's rarity without expressing a clear positive or negative emotion, so the sentiment is neutral.\n\nAnswer: 2", 2, 3, 33.49474174898933], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The word \"terrific\" stands out immediately because it's a strong positive adjective. It means excellent or wonderful, so that's a big clue towards positivity. \n\nNext, looking at the rest of the sentence: \"insider look at the star-making machinery of tinseltown.\" This part is more descriptive and doesn't carry much sentiment on its own. It seems to be talking about an in-depth view into how stars are made in Hollywood, which is a neutral observation.\n\nPutting it together, the presence of \"terrific\" indicates a positive sentiment. The rest of the sentence doesn't add any negative or additional positive words, so the overall tone is definitely leaning towards positive. \n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). Since \"terrific\" is a strong positive word but there's nothing else that amplifies it further, I don't think it reaches a 4 (which would require something like \"amazing,\" \"fantastic,\" or more exclamation).

It's talking about a movie called \"Crush\" and comparing it negatively to another film, \"Valley of the Dolls,\" which I know was also criticized for its portrayal of women. The phrase \"the worst film a man has made about women\" is clearly negative because it suggests that the director (a man) did a poor job in depicting women, perhaps implying sexism or insensitivity.\n\nThe word \"could be\" makes it a bit tentative, but overall, the sentiment is strongly negative. There's no positive language here; instead, it's pointing out what's wrong with the film. So, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, and this seems to fit because it's not just a mild criticism but a strong one comparing it to another negatively received film.\n\nI don't see any neutral or positive elements in the statement. It's all about how bad the film is, especially regarding its treatment of women. So I think the sentiment here is very negative.\n</think>\n\nThe statement strongly criticizes the film \"Crush,\" comparing it unfavorably to another disliked movie.

There's no negative language here; instead, it's a clear compliment.\n\nSo the sentiment should be positive. Looking at the options, 3 is positive and 4 is very positive.

The main subject here is a movie, so it's about film criticism or review. The adjectives used are \"dopey\" and \"clothed in excess layers of hipness.\" I need to assess each part for sentiment.\n\n\"Dopey\" usually means silly or not very smart, right? So that word has a negative connotation. It suggests the movie is perhaps overly simplistic or lacking depth. That would lean towards a more negative sentiment.\n\nThen there's \"clothed in excess layers of hipness.\" The word \"hipness\" can be positive as it implies trendy or stylish. However, adding \"excess layers\" might mean that they're overdoing it. So while the intention could be to praise the movie for being trendy, the use of \"excess\" suggests it's too much and maybe even overwhelming or insincere.\n\nPutting these together: The first part is clearly negative, and the second part has a mixed but leaning negative nuance because of the excess. Overall, the sentiment seems more on the negative side.\n\nSo thinking about the scale:\n- 0: Very Negative\n- 1: Negative\n- 2: Neutral\n- 3: Positive\n- 4: Very Positive\n\nThe text is critical but not extremely so. It's pointing out that the movie is dopey and overly trying to be hip. So it's negative, maybe a 1 or perhaps a 0. But since it's not extremely harsh, just calling it dopey without more severe words, I think 1 would make sense.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses \"dopey\" to negatively describe the movie and mentions excessive layers of hipness, suggesting it's overdone.

It's a comparison between Brian De Palma and Alfred Hitchcock movies, with the twist of watching Hitchcock after drinking twelve beers.\n\nBrian De Palma is known for his suspenseful films, often compared to Hitchcock, who is a master of the genre. So, comparing them directly might suggest that De Palma's work has similar qualities but perhaps with some added elements.\n\nNow, the part about watching Hitchcock after twelve beers. Drinking twelve beers implies being intoxicated, which can make things seem different. Maybe it means that viewing Hitchcock in an altered state makes the experience more intense or chaotic than usual.\n\nPutting this together: If watching De Palma is like a drunk Hitchcock, it could mean that De Palma's movies are intense and perhaps over-the-top compared to Hitchcock's controlled style. This might be seen as both a compliment (intense) and a criticism (maybe too much). However, in film contexts, being more intense can sometimes be viewed positively if the viewer enjoys that style.\n\nI should consider whether this comparison is meant to praise or criticize De Palma. If it's intended to say his movies are thrilling and gripping, even more so than Hitchcock's, then it could lean positive. But if it's suggesting they're chaotic or overwhelming, maybe leaning negative.\n\nBut I think the use of \"after drinking twelve beers\" is a way to emphasize that watching De Palma is an intense experience, perhaps more so than Hitchcock's normally calm and suspenseful style. So this might be a positive sentiment because it highlights the intensity and impact of his movies.\n\nHowever, it's not extremely effusive praise; it's more of a comparison with a tweak. So maybe it's not very positive (4) but still on the positive side, perhaps 3.\n</think>\n\nThe text compares Brian De Palma's films to watching Hitchcock after drinking twelve beers, suggesting an intense and thrilling experience.

The phrase \"stirs potentially enticing ingredients\" suggests that there's something attractive or appealing being mixed together. The word \"enticing\" has a positive connotation, indicating something alluring or tempting.\n\nHowever, the next part says it's an \"uneasy blend.\" Uneasy implies discomfort or anxiety, which is negative. So now I have a mix of positive and negative elements here. \n\nThen there's a reference to \"ghost\" and \"close encounters of the third kind.\" Ghosts are often associated with fear or unsettling feelings, while Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a movie that mixes wonder with some suspense but isn't overtly negative.\n\nPutting it all together: The text starts with something positive (\"enticing ingredients\") but quickly shifts to an uneasy mix. So overall, the sentiment seems mixed but leans more towards neutral because there's both an attractive and a discomforting element mentioned. \n\nI don't think it's very positive or very negative; it's somewhere in between.

Then 1 is just negative, maybe a bit disappointed but not as intense. Neutral is 2, which means no strong feelings either way. Positive is 3 and very positive is 4.\n\nLooking at the example text: \"the movie is about as deep as that sentiment.\" The word \"deep\" can be tricky here because it's neutral on its own. It doesn't inherently have a positive or negative connotation. So, when someone says a movie is as deep as something else, they could mean either good or bad depending on context.\n\nIn this case, the comparison is to \"that sentiment.\" But without knowing what \"that sentiment\" refers to, it's hard to gauge the feeling. If \"that sentiment\" was positive, then maybe the movie is praised for being profound. If it's negative, perhaps the movie isn't as impactful as expected.\n\nSince there's no explicit positive or negative language here, like words such as \"wonderful,\" \"terrible,\" etc., I can't lean towards a definite 3 or 1. The statement is more observational than expressive of emotion. Therefore, the sentiment is neutral, which corresponds to 2.\n\nI should make sure not to overthink it.

Those phrases suggest that the film has good production quality and presentation.\n\nBut then it says \"ultimately falls prey to the contradiction.\" The word \"prey\" here implies that something bad happened because of a flaw or issue\u2014specifically, a contradiction that's common in movies about writers.

The text mentions \"excellent,\" which is a strong positive adjective. That immediately tips me off that the sentiment is likely positive. However, the user wants more than just a keyword analysis; they want a nuanced evaluation.\n\nNext, I consider the context. The phrase continues by saying they are excellent in a \"low-key way.\" This suggests that their performance isn't flashy or over-the-top but still effective and impressive. It's a compliment on their subtlety and authenticity, which adds depth to the positive sentiment.\n\nThe last part mentions that it allows us to forget they're movie folk.

Neutral (2) might be a consideration if the text were more factual without emotion, but the use of \"excellent\" and the praise for their low-key style make it leaning towards positive.\n\nBetween 3 (positive) and 4 (very positive), I need to decide which fits better. The word \"excellent\" is strong, but there's no superlative or extreme language beyond that. The compliment is sincere but not hyperbolic. So, while it's definitely positive, it might not reach the level of very positive.\n\nPutting it all together: the sentiment is clearly positive due to words like \"excellent,\" appreciation for their acting style, and the impact on the audience.

The fact that they want to be remembered in a more complex way might suggest they value being understood deeply, but it doesn't necessarily add positivity; it's more about a need not being met.\n\nPutting it all together, the dominant feelings are of pain and unmet needs, which are negative. There isn't much positivity here, so I'm leaning towards either 0 (very negative) or 1 (negative). The use of strong words like \"suffered\" and \"bled\" makes me think it's more than just a little negative; it's quite intense.\n\nWait, but maybe the person is expressing a desire for deeper recognition, which could be seen as a positive wish.

It's talking about \"my big fat greek wedding\" being a rare animal called 'a perfect family film' because it's about family.\n\nThe words here are pretty positive. They use terms like \"rare animal,\" which isn't common but in this context, it seems to be used positively as something special. Then they call it 'a perfect family film,' which is definitely a compliment. The reason given is that it's about family, which implies the reviewer appreciates its focus on family values.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment here is positive. Now, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, so that's not it. Negative (1) also doesn't fit because there's nothing negative here. Neutral (2) could be a thought, but the use of \"perfect\" suggests more than just neutral. So between 3 and 4.\n\nThe phrase 'rare animal' adds to the uniqueness and positive aspect, making it stand out as not just good but exceptional in its category. Therefore, this seems like a very positive sentiment rather than just positive.\n\nWait, but sometimes using \"perfect\" can be strong, so maybe it's a 4? Or is 3 enough because while it's glowing, it might not reach the 'very' level. Hmm.\n\nI think given that they're calling it 'a perfect family film,' which is high praise, and highlighting its focus on family as a positive aspect, it leans more towards very positive rather than just positive.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 3, 38.16444679599954], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The word \"overproduced\" suggests that there was too much done, which might imply it's not effective. Then, \"piece of dreck\" \u2013 I know \"dreck\" means something worthless or garbage, so that's definitely negative. \n\nNext, \"shockingly bad\" uses \"bad,\" which is clearly negative, and adds the word \"shockingly\" to emphasize how surprisingly bad it was. Finally, \"absolutely unnecessary\" indicates that whatever this piece is, it wasn't needed and perhaps even harmful or wasteful.\n\nPutting it all together: The text uses strong negative adjectives like \"dreck,\" \"bad,\" and \"unnecessary,\" with intensifiers like \"overproduced\" and \"shockingly.\" This makes the sentiment very negative.

The sentence says, \"The film is delicately narrated by Martin Landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by Dana Janklowicz-Mann.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break it down word by word. \"Delicately narrated\" sounds positive because delicate can mean something done with care or subtlety, which are generally seen as good traits. \"Directed with sensitivity and skill\" also uses positive adjectives like 'sensitive' and 'skillful', both of which indicate that the direction was well-done.\n\nThe sentence doesn't have any negative words, so I'm leaning towards a positive sentiment. Since it's using strong adjectives to praise both the narration and directing, it seems more than just neutral or slightly positive. It feels like it's giving high praise without being overly exaggerated. \n\nSo, considering the scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, this should be on the higher end but not extremely so.

It mentions that while it's not up against \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" which was a huge success and won Oscars, Red Dragon is still considered an exceptional thriller.\n\nThe key words here are \"exceptional\" and \"thriller.\" Exceptional is clearly positive, indicating that the film stands out in its category. Thriller suggests that it's engaging and suspenseful, which are desirable qualities for such a genre.\n\nThere's also a comparison to another successful film, but instead of being negative, this sets a high benchmark against which Red Dragon is still rated positively. The structure doesn't show any negative connotations; it's more about highlighting its strengths relative to others.\n\nSo, the sentiment is positive. Now, determining how strong that positivity is. \"Exceptional\" is quite strong, so it goes beyond just being good. It's on the higher end of positive sentiments.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), 4 (very positive). The use of \"exceptional\" leans towards a very positive sentiment, which would be a 4.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence praises \"Red Dragon\" as an exceptional thriller compared to others in its genre.

The sentence given is: \"An achingly enthralling premise, the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the words used here to understand the sentiment better.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"an achingly enthralling premise.\" The word \"achingly\" might seem a bit negative at first because of its association with pain or discomfort. However, in this context, it's paired with \"enthralling,\" which is positive. So \"achingly enthralling\" likely means that the premise is so compelling that it almost causes a kind of emotional ache, indicating strong engagement or fascination.\n\nNext, looking at the second part: \"the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses.\" The word \"hindered\" suggests something is holding back or making things difficult. Uneven dialogue could mean the conversations in the film aren't consistent or smooth, which is a negative point. Similarly, \"plot lapses\" imply that there are weaknesses or inconsistencies in the storyline, another negative aspect.\n\nSo putting it together: The premise is very engaging and positive, but the execution\u2014dialogue and plot\u2014are problematic. It's a mix of strong positives and noticeable negatives.\n\nI need to assess which sentiment outweighs the other. The first part praises the premise as enthralling, which is quite positive. However, the second part points out significant flaws in dialogue and plot, which are critical elements that can greatly affect the overall film experience. \n\nIf I consider the structure of the sentence: it starts with a strong positive but immediately follows with substantial negatives. The use of \"hindered\" suggests that despite the good premise, these issues hold the film back.\n\nIn sentiment analysis, the presence of both positive and negative elements usually leads to a neutral or slightly negative sentiment if the negatives are more impactful. Here, the negatives about dialogue and plot lapses might be more significant because they directly affect how the story unfolds and how characters interact, which can overshadow an otherwise good premise.\n\nTherefore, considering both aspects but perhaps giving more weight to the critical elements, I think the overall sentiment leans towards negative but not extremely so. It's not a very positive review, nor is it extremely negative because there is some praise for the premise. So maybe it's negative (1) or neutral (2).\n\nHowever, since the negative points are about key aspects of the film that could significantly impact the viewer's experience, I might lean towards classifying this as negative rather than neutral.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text leans towards negative due to the significant issues highlighted with the film's dialogue and plot, despite a positive premise. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 56.51608834601939], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The structure here starts with a negative statement\u2014no one has cared much. Then they list specific aspects: cheesy screenplay, grayish lighting, and a last-minute, haphazard release.\n\nCheesy usually implies that the screenplay was low quality or perhaps too predictable. Grayish lighting might suggest poor visuals or an unappealing atmosphere. The last-minute theatrical release sounds rushed and poorly planned. All these points seem to be criticisms of whatever they're talking about\u2014maybe a movie?\n\nPutting it all together, each of those aspects is being criticized negatively. There's no positive language here; everything mentioned seems to be pointing out flaws or shortcomings. So the sentiment expressed is definitely negative.\n\nNow, I need to classify this on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). Since every aspect is criticized without any redeeming qualities mentioned, it feels strongly negative. But how strong?\n\nThe phrases used are pretty harsh: \"cheesy,\" \"grayish quality,\" \"last-minute,\" \"haphazard.\" These are all quite critical terms. However, the overall structure isn't using superlatives like \"terrible\" or \"awful\"\u2014it's more about listing issues without extreme language.\n\nSo maybe it's a 1 (negative) rather than a 0 (very negative). Alternatively, if I consider that each point is significant and contributes to an overall harsh critique, perhaps it's leaning towards very negative. But the initial phrase is \"nobody seems to have cared much,\" which isn't as intense as saying something was hated or awful.\n\nI think the sentiment is negative but not extremely so because while there are multiple criticisms, the language doesn't escalate beyond pointing out flaws without extreme adjectives. Therefore, I'd lean towards a 1.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses several criticisms about different aspects of a subject, using terms like \"cheesy,\" \"grayish quality,\" and \"haphazard.\" These are all negative descriptors, indicating dissatisfaction.

Crispin Glover is described as messing things up in an old-school way\u2014so that's another negative point.\n\nPutting it all together, the text seems to be expressing a lot of criticism and disappointment.

It starts by mentioning Shakespeare's eloquent language, which is clearly a compliment. But then it says \"without\" that, so whatever follows isn't as good. The update is described as \"dreary and sluggish.\" Both of these words have negative connotations. Dreary means something is boring or depressing, while sluggish implies it's slow and inefficient.\n\nSo the overall sentiment here seems negative because it's comparing a less favorable version to Shakespeare's work. Even though Shakespeare is praised, the focus is on how without him, the update isn't good. That makes me think the main point is criticism of the update being poor.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, which would be if the text was extremely harsh. But here, it's just pointing out that the update lacks something and uses two negative adjectives. It's not using any super strong words like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" so maybe it's a 1 for negative.\n\nWait, but sometimes \"dreary\" can be quite strong, implying a sense of gloominess. Maybe I should consider that. However, the text doesn't use exclamation points or other intensifiers, so perhaps it's still just a regular negative sentiment rather than very negative.\n\nI don't think it's neutral because the adjectives are clearly negative. It's not positive at all. So between 0 and 1. Since \"dreary\" is pretty strong but the overall context isn't extremely harsh, I might lean towards 1 for negative instead of 0 which is reserved for very negative sentiments.\n\nSo, putting it together: The sentiment is negative because of the use of \"dreary\" and \"sluggish,\" but not the strongest possible negative.

The text is: \"there are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what's being said here. The sentence starts by mentioning that there are various definitions of a \"time waster,\" which I take to mean something that doesn't use time effectively or is unproductive. Then it says that the movie in question must surely be one of them. So, the speaker is comparing the movie to other things considered time-wasters.\n\nI think the key word here is \"time waster.\" That's a negative term because it implies that the movie didn't make good use of the viewer's time. It suggests that watching this movie was a waste and not worth the effort. So, the sentiment isn't just neutral; it has a negative connotation.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. Since the text is clearly expressing dissatisfaction with the movie by labeling it as a time waster, that's more than just a neutral or slightly negative sentiment. It's a stronger negative statement.\n\nI don't think it's extremely negative (0) because there's no use of strong language or explicit frustration beyond calling it a time waster.

Let's break down the text.\n\nThe sentence starts with \"after several scenes of this tacky nonsense,\" which immediately uses strong negative words like \"tacky\" and \"nonsense.\" This suggests that the speaker has a very low opinion of whatever they're describing, likely a movie or show. \n\nNext, it says, \"you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions.\" Here, \"wistful\" indicates a longing or nostalgia for something else, which implies that the current subject is lacking compared to what's being remembered. The term \"testosterone-charged wizardry\" seems positive when referring to Jerry Bruckheimer's work, known for action-packed and high-energy movies. This contrast highlights how much better Bruckheimer's productions are in the speaker's eyes.\n\nThen it says, \"especially because half past dead is like the rock on a Walmart budget.\" Comparing \"half past dead\" to \"The Rock,\" which is a well-known action film, but adding that it's done on a Walmart budget suggests it's cheaper and of lower quality. This comparison reinforces the negative sentiment towards \"half past dead.\"\n\nPutting this all together: The text criticizes something as tacky and low-quality, longing for better productions and comparing it unfavorably to a famous movie with less budget. The overall tone is negative. However, since there are some comparative elements that might hint at potential positives elsewhere (referring to Bruckheimer's work), but the focus is clearly on the negativity of \"half past dead.\"\n\nSo, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative.

The sentence is \"an extraordinary dramatic experience.\" Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the word \"extraordinary\" stands out. That usually means something is beyond ordinary, really good or impressive. It's a strong positive adjective. Then there's \"dramatic,\" which can be tricky because it doesn't always have a clear positive or negative connotation. But in this context, paired with \"extraordinary,\" I think it adds to the intensity of the experience.\n\nPutting them together, the phrase is talking about an experience that's both extraordinary and dramatic.

The subject here is Rifkin's references. The adjective used to describe them is \"impeccable,\" which I know means flawless or perfect. That seems pretty positive right off the bat.\n\nNext, looking at the structure of the sentence: \"Rifkin's references are ... impeccable throughout.\" The use of \"... impeccable\" emphasizes that every single reference Rifkin has made is without flaw. The word \"throughout\" adds to this, indicating consistency over time or across all instances.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. It's straightforward praise for Rifkin's work. There's no ambiguity in the statement; it's clearly stating that the references are impeccable. \n\nI should consider if there's any sarcasm or irony, but given the context provided, I don't think so. The sentence seems genuine and positive.\n\nNow, mapping this to the scale: 0 is very negative, which isn't the case here. Negative (1) also doesn't fit because there are no critical words. Neutral (2) might be a stretch if someone thinks \"impeccable\" is just an average compliment, but I think it's stronger than that. \n\nPositive (3) seems appropriate because it's a strong compliment without being extremely effusive. Very positive (4) would require even stronger language or more superlatives, which aren't present here. The word \"impeccable\" is definitely positive but might not reach the level of \"very positive.\"\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think this sentence conveys a positive sentiment but perhaps not the most extreme form.

Let me read through the given sentence carefully.\n\nThe sentence is: \"the unique niche of self-critical, behind-the-scenes navel-gazing kaufman has carved from orleans' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the key phrases here. The main subject seems to be about Kaufman's work, specifically referring to it as a \"unique niche.\" That already sounds positive because \"unique\" implies something special or different in a good way.\n\nNext, there are some adjectives used: \"self-critical,\" which could be neutral but might lean towards a slightly negative aspect if taken literally, but in this context, it's probably referring to self-reflection rather than criticism. Then \"behind-the-scenes navel-gazing\" \u2013 \"navel-gazing\" usually has a somewhat negative connotation, suggesting introspection that's perhaps too focused on oneself or lacking depth.\n\nHowever, the sentence goes on to say that this niche is \"a work of outstanding originality.\" The words \"outstanding\" and \"originality\" are definitely positive. Outstanding means excellent, and originality implies creativity without copying others.\n\nPutting it all together, while there might be some elements that could be seen as neutral or even slightly negative (like navel-gazing), the overall sentiment is heavily influenced by the positive descriptors at the end. The phrase \"outstanding originality\" strongly suggests a very positive opinion of Kaufman's work.\n\nSo considering all this, the sentiment is clearly positive.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the words used. The sentence starts with \"amateurish,\" which generally has a negative connotation.

That makes me think it's leaning towards negative sentiment.\n\nBut then there's a\u8f6c\u6298\u8bcd \"but\" introducing another part of the sentence: \"it 's a minor treat.\" The word \"treat\" is positive, meaning enjoyable or pleasant. However, it's modified by \"minor,\" which lessens its impact. So while there's a positive aspect mentioned, it's not very strong.\n\nPutting this together, the sentiment isn't entirely negative because of the positive element, but the initial adjective is quite negative. The positivity is soft, so I have to balance these two parts.\n\nI think about how sentiment analysis works. It often looks for keywords and their intensity. \"Amateurish\" is a stronger negative word compared to \"minor treat,\" which is a weaker positive. So maybe the overall sentiment is slightly negative but not extremely so.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, etc. The text isn't all bad because of the minor treat, but it's still more on the negative side due to \"amateurish.\" Therefore, I might lean towards a 1 (negative) sentiment.\n\nWait, but could it be neutral? Neutral would mean there's no clear leaning. However, since \"amateurish\" is clearly negative and \"minor treat\" only slightly positive, the overall sentiment is still more negative than neutral.

The person finds something funny or entertaining about the situation.\n\nThey're talking about society having reached a point where making a film about hiring someone to play Richard Dawson is important enough. Richard Dawson was a game show host, known for \"Family Feud.\" It might seem trivial to some that a movie is made about this, but the person finds it amusing, which suggests they think it's an odd or perhaps humorous turn of events.\n\nSo, putting that together: amusement implies positivity. They're not negative; instead, they find it funny or interesting that such a film exists. There's no indication of sarcasm or hidden negativity here. It seems like a genuine positive sentiment because \"amused\" is a positive emotion.\n\nI don't see any words that would indicate a neutral stance. The use of \"highly amused\" makes it clear the feeling is strong, but not extremely so\u2014maybe around a 3 on the scale where 4 is very positive. However, considering the context isn't overly enthusiastic beyond being amused, I think 3 is appropriate here.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is positive because the speaker finds the situation amusing, which indicates a favorable emotional response.\n\n3", 3, 4, 32.99477179799578], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user provided an example where they took a sentence and decided it was a 3, which is positive. Now, I have to apply that same logic to another sentence: \"like all great films about a life you never knew existed , it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the components of this sentence. The text starts with \"like all great films,\" which immediately sets a positive tone because \"great\" is a strong positive adjective. It's comparing the film to others that are considered great, so that's a good sign.\n\nNext, it mentions \"a life you never knew existed.\" This part suggests that the film presents something new or unknown, which can be intriguing and engaging for the audience. That's another positive aspect because it highlights the uniqueness of the film's subject matter.\n\nThen the sentence says, \"it offers much to absorb.\" The word \"much\" indicates quantity, so there's a lot to take in, which is generally a positive trait for a film as it implies depth and substance. People often appreciate movies that offer a lot to think about or digest after watching.\n\nFinally, it adds, \"and even more to think about after the final frame.\" This reinforces the idea that the film leaves a lasting impact and encourages reflection beyond just the viewing experience. It suggests that the film is thought-provoking and has staying power, which are definitely positive attributes.\n\nPutting this all together, each part of the sentence contributes positively to the overall sentiment. There's praise for the film being great, highlighting its unique subject matter, and emphasizing the depth and after-effect it leaves on the viewer. The language used is enthusiastic without being overly effusive, so I think the sentiment here falls into a positive category.\n\nComparing this to the previous example where the user gave a 3, which was positive, this sentence seems equally or perhaps even more laudatory. However, since the user might have considered factors like the strength of the adjectives and the overall tone, I don't think it's extremely positive (which would be a 4). It's definitely positive but not hyperbolic.\n\nSo, after analyzing each component and considering the sentiment scale provided, I believe this text should be classified as a 3\u2014positive.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 4, 49.43123497799388], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user provided a sentence: \"a compelling french psychological drama examining the encounter of an aloof father and his chilly son after 20 years apart.\" They want me to classify it as 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), or 4 (very positive).\n\nFirst, I should break down the sentence. The word \"compelling\" stands out because that's a strong positive adjective. It suggests something is engaging and interesting, which is a positive sentiment.\n\nNext, looking at \"french psychological drama,\" this part doesn't carry much emotional weight on its own; it's just describing the genre and origin of the work. So, neutral here.\n\nThen, there's \"examining the encounter of an aloof father and his chilly son.\" The words \"aloof\" and \"chilly\" describe negative traits\u2014aloof means distant or unsympathetic, while chilly can mean unfriendly or emotionally cold. However, these are describing characters rather than expressing sentiment about the work itself.\n\nThe phrase \"after 20 years apart\" sets up a context of a long separation, which could be either positive or neutral depending on how it's framed. Since it's part of the examination of their encounter, it adds depth but doesn't lean negative or positive by itself.\n\nPutting it all together: The main sentiment comes from \"compelling,\" which is positive. Even though there are descriptors for the characters that might imply some tension or conflict, the overall classification is based on the sentiment expressed about the work. Since the work is described as compelling, the sentiment leans towards positive.\n\nI should consider if \"compelling\" is strong enough to make it a 3 (positive) or maybe even a 4 (very positive). However, the sentence doesn't use superlatives beyond \"compelling,\" so perhaps it's a solid positive but not extremely so. Therefore, I think classifying this as 3 makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment is classified based on the word \"compelling,\" which is positive but not excessively strong. \n\n3", 3, 3, 43.16417610598728], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence is: \"There's very little sense to what's going on here, but the makers serve up the clich\u00e9s with considerable dash.\" \n\nOkay, let's break it down. First part says there's very little sense, which sounds negative because it implies confusion or lack of meaning. That would lean towards a lower sentiment score, maybe 0 or 1.\n\nBut then the second part says the makers are serving up clich\u00e9s with considerable dash. \"Dash\" here probably means enthusiasm or energy. So even though they're using clich\u00e9s, which can be seen as unoriginal, they're doing it energetically. This seems positive because it's acknowledging that despite the predictability, there's something engaging about how it's done.\n\nSo now I have conflicting sentiments: negative from the first part and positive from the second. The key is to weigh which one is stronger or more impactful. \n\nThe first part starts with a strong negative statement, but the second part might balance it out because it's pointing out an entertaining aspect. It doesn't completely negate the confusion but adds a layer of positivity.\n\nI think the overall sentiment isn't extremely positive because of the initial criticism, nor is it very negative because there's a redeeming quality mentioned. So it probably falls into the neutral category or slightly positive. \n\nConsidering the scale: 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), 4 (very positive). The sentence isn't extremely one way, so maybe a 2 for neutral, but since there's a positive element, it might tip towards 3.\n\nWait, another thought. If the makers are using clich\u00e9s energetically, that could be seen as making up for the lack of sense. So perhaps it's more positive than just neutral. But I don't think it's extremely positive because the first part is still a criticism.\n\nHmm, maybe 2 or 3. Since the sentence starts with a negative but ends on a more positive note, I'll go with 3 as the sentiment is leaning towards positive despite the initial issue.\n</think>\n\nThe text presents conflicting sentiments: a negative aspect about lack of sense and a positive element regarding energetic use of clich\u00e9s.

It doesn't express any strong emotion on its own\u2014it's more of an inquiry than a statement with clear sentiment.\n\nI should consider the context where this phrase might be used. For example, if someone is excited and looking forward to something, \"what's next?\" could imply anticipation, which would lean towards positive. On the other hand, if someone is feeling uncertain or anxious about what comes next, it might carry a negative connotation.\n\nBut without additional context, the phrase doesn't inherently express any emotion. It's neutral because it's asking for information rather than expressing a sentiment.\n\nI don't see any words that indicate positivity or negativity here. There are no adjectives or emotional language used. So, based on just this phrase, I should default to a neutral sentiment.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate classification would be 2, which stands for neutral.\n</think>\n\nThe text \"what's next?\" is an inquiry without expressed emotion, making it neutral.\n\nAnswer: 2", 2, 3, 31.741911379009252], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break down the sentence step by step.\n\nThe sentence is: \"the film's plot may be shallow, but you've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots.\"\n\nFirst part: \"the film's plot may be shallow.\" This seems negative because shallow implies that the plot lacks depth or substance. So this contributes a negative sentiment.\n\nSecond part: \"but you've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots.\" The word \"harrowing\" usually has a negative connotation, meaning causing intense distress or fear. However, in the context of surf shots, it might be used to describe intense or dramatic visuals, which could be impressive.\n\nSo there's a contrast here: the plot is shallow (negative), but the visual elements are intense and possibly well-done (positive). The overall sentiment seems mixed because one part is negative while the other is positive. Since the user asked for a single integer classification, I have to decide whether it leans more towards neutral or has a slight positivity.\n\nThe use of \"but\" indicates that despite the shallow plot, there's something commendable about the surf shots. So even though the film isn't perfect, there's a highlight worth mentioning. This might make the sentiment slightly positive rather than neutral because the second part is highlighting a strong point.\n\nHowever, since the negative and positive aspects are both present but not extremely pronounced in either direction, I think the sentiment is closer to neutral or slightly positive. Given that 2 is neutral, 3 is positive, and considering the emphasis on the impressive surf shots despite the plot issue, it might be better to classify this as slightly positive.\n\nBut I'm a bit torn because while there's a negative point, the positive part isn't extremely strong either. So maybe it's still more balanced, making it neutral. Alternatively, since \"harrowing\" could add intensity but not necessarily positivity, perhaps it leans more towards neutral.\n\nWait, the word \"never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots\" suggests that the visuals are exceptional or intense, which can be a positive aspect for some viewers. So maybe the sentiment is slightly positive because despite the plot issue, there's something impressive about the film.\n\nI think I'll go with 2 (neutral) because while there's a negative and a positive point, they balance each other out. But considering the emphasis on the visuals being intense and possibly well-executed, it might tip towards 3 (positive).

It talks about history, music, and a lesson in scratching. These are all neutral to positive topics because they're informative or engaging.\n\nThen, there's a transition with \"but,\" which sometimes indicates a contrast. However, the part after \"but\" is \"most of all, see it for the passion.\" Passion is definitely a positive word; it conveys enthusiasm and dedication. The overall tone seems encouraging and appreciative.\n\nI don't see any negative words or phrases here. It's more about highlighting different aspects of scratching in a positive light.

Alternatively, it could be a play on words or a made-up term. Regardless, the focus is on the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nLooking at the descriptors used: \"spree of flesh, buzz, blab and money.\" The word \"flesh\" might have negative connotations if implying immorality or excess. \"Buzz\" usually refers to excitement, which is positive. \"Blab\" suggests excessive talking, possibly gossip, which could be neutral or slightly negative. \"Money\" in this context likely refers to the financial aspect, which can be seen as a positive or just factual.\n\nPutting it all together, the tone doesn't seem overly positive or negative.

The sentence given is: \"Fans of critics' darling band Wilco will marvel at the sometimes murky, always brooding look of I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the components. The subject here is fans of Wilco, a band that's described as the critics' darling. That already gives a positive connotation because being a critic's favorite usually implies quality or acclaim.\n\nThe phrase \"will marvel at\" suggests admiration or appreciation. So fans are marvelling, which is a positive action. They're looking at something specific: the look of their album, \"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.\" \n\nNow, describing the look as \"sometimes murky\" and \"always brooding\" might seem neutral or even slightly negative on first glance because words like murky can imply something dark or unclear. However, in a musical context, especially with a band known for its introspective and sometimes darker themes, these descriptors are likely meant to highlight the album's depth and artistic style rather than criticize it negatively.\n\nSo putting it all together: fans of a respected band appreciate an album that has a certain mood (murky and brooding), which adds to its appeal. The overall sentiment seems positive because it's about admiration for the album's characteristics, even if those characteristics have some darker elements.\n\nI don't see any negative words here except maybe \"murky\" and \"brooding,\" but in this context, they're being used descriptively rather than pejoratively.

The phrase mentions it's \"one of the funniest movies,\" which uses a superlative form with \"funniest.\" Superlatives often indicate a strong sentiment, so that suggests something positive.\n\nNext, I consider the context. When someone describes a movie as one of the funniest, they're typically expressing a high level of satisfaction or enjoyment. This isn't just a neutral statement; it's clearly praising the film for its humor.\n\nI should also think about the structure. The sentence is structured in a way that highlights the positivity without any negative words or qualifiers. There's no ambiguity here\u2014it's straightforward praise.\n\nAnother point to consider is the comparison implied by \"one of.\" It suggests that this movie stands out among others, which again points towards a positive sentiment rather than just being average.\n\nI don't see any sarcasm or irony in the statement, so it's safe to take it at face value. The enthusiasm in describing it as funny indicates a very positive sentiment.\n\nSo putting it all together: superlative language (\"funniest\"), straightforward praise, and implied comparison all point towards a high level of positivity.

So far, this feels like praise.\n\nThe key part is \"had their hearts in the right place.\" This idiom means they were sincere or well-intentioned. It's a compliment because it shows they put genuine effort into whatever they were doing. \n\nPutting it together, the sentence is affirming that everyone was sincere and did their best.

It seems like it's talking about two entities, \"time out\" and \"human resources,\" working together to establish Mr. Cantet in France as the top \"cinematic poet of the workplace.\" The term \"cinematic poet\" sounds quite positive because poets are usually associated with creativity and artistry. So using that title suggests he's being praised for his work.\n\nThe word \"foremost\" also adds a layer of positivity, meaning he's leading or prominent in this field. There's no negative language here; everything points towards commendation. The use of parentheses around the entities doesn't affect the sentiment\u2014it's just indicating an aside about who is establishing him.\n\nI don't see any negative words like \"criticized,\" \"problem,\" or anything that would lower the sentiment score.

The user provided a sentence: \"an old-fashioned drama of substance about a teacher's slide down the slippery slope of dishonesty after an encounter with the rich and the powerful who have nothing but disdain for virtue.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what sentiment analysis entails. It's about determining whether a piece of text expresses positive, negative, or neutral feelings. In this case, it can be one of five options: 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), or 4 (very positive).\n\nLooking at the sentence, I notice several key words and phrases that might indicate sentiment:\n\n- \"old-fashioned drama of substance\": This seems neutral to slightly positive. It suggests that it's a classic drama with depth.\n\n- \"slide down the slippery slope of dishonesty\": The phrase \"slippery slope\" usually has a negative connotation, implying a descent into something bad or unethical. Dishonesty is clearly a negative trait.\n\n- \"encounter with the rich and powerful who have nothing but disdain for virtue\": Disdain means contempt or scorn, which are negative emotions. Virtue is positive, so disdaining it further adds to the negative sentiment.\n\nPutting this together, the overall tone seems negative because of words like \"dishonesty,\" \"disdain,\" and the implication that the teacher's path leads to moral downfall. The mention of rich and powerful people having disdain for virtue suggests a critique or negative view of their influence.\n\nI should also consider if there are any positive aspects. While it mentions an old-fashioned drama of substance, which could be seen as positive, the dominant theme seems to be about the slide into dishonesty influenced by negative forces (rich and powerful). So the overall sentiment leans more towards negative rather than neutral or positive.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this sentiment as 1 (negative) because it's clearly negative but not extremely so. It doesn't express extreme negativity like despair or hate; instead, it's a critique of dishonesty and disdain for virtue.\n</think>\n\nThe text discusses a teacher's moral decline influenced by negative forces, using terms like \"dishonesty\" and \"disdain for virtue.\" While there's a neutral mention of substance, the overall tone is negative. \n\n1", 1, 3, 48.61964936600998], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, looking at the words used. \"Nothing\" is a strong negation, which usually indicates something negative. Then \"remotely\" emphasizes that there's absolutely no aspect of being topical or sexy. So the speaker is clearly disappointed or unimpressed.\n\nThe phrase \"topical or sexy\" suggests that the person was expecting content that's current or appealing but found none of that. That disappointment would lean towards a negative sentiment.\n\nI should consider if this is just neutral dissatisfaction or something stronger. The use of strong words like \"nothing\" and \"remotely\" makes it more negative than just a casual remark. So, it's not just a little negative; it's quite harsh.\n\nNow, mapping that to the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The sentiment here is definitely negative but not extremely so.

But here, the director is resisting that urge, which could be seen as positive\u2014maybe showing restraint and integrity.\n\nSo putting it together: The story's emotional approach is described negatively (\"maudlin\"), but the director's choice to avoid sensationalism is a positive trait. It's a bit of a mixed sentiment.\n\nI need to weigh these elements. The negative term \"maudlin\" might carry more weight because it directly describes the storytelling style, which could be off-putting to some viewers or readers. However, the director's approach is being commended for not sensationalizing, which is a positive point.\n\nBut the overall sentence seems to highlight that despite trying to avoid sensationalism, the story comes across as maudlin. So maybe the negative aspect is more prominent here because the result (maudlin) isn't desired.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the sentiment leans slightly negative but not extremely so. It's not a very positive review because of the criticism about being too sentimental in a tiresome way.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 1, 37.982960041001206], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the sentence again. It says that if there's nothing (none), then there's a problem. That makes it sound like something is missing or not available, which might be concerning.\n\nThe phrase \"you have a problem\" directly indicates an issue. Problems are generally negative situations because they imply difficulty, trouble, or something that needs fixing. So the overall sentiment here seems to be pointing towards something negative.\n\nIs there any positivity in this statement? It doesn't look like it. The focus is on the absence of something leading to a problem, which isn't a positive outlook. There's no encouragement or positive spin; it's straightforwardly stating an issue.\n\nSo considering the options: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. Since there's definitely a negative implication but not extremely so, I'd say this falls into category 1, which is negative.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment of the text is negative because it highlights an issue or problem arising from the absence of something, indicating a problematic situation without any positive elements.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 2, 26.852572875010082], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase starts with \"it's a shame,\" which immediately indicates disappointment or regret. That suggests a negative tone right away.\n\nNext, the user mentions the storyline and themes being \"impersonal\" or \"shallow.\" Both of these adjectives are negative. \"Impersonal\" implies a lack of connection or emotion, while \"shallow\" means lacking depth. These words convey dissatisfaction with how the content was presented.\n\nThe structure also matters here. The use of ellipsis (the three dots) might indicate that something is missing or not fully explored, adding to the negative sentiment. The overall message seems critical, pointing out flaws in the storyline's depth and emotional impact.\n\nConsidering the scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive. This text doesn't express extreme negativity (like anger or hate), but it does show clear dissatisfaction. So it's not a 1 because that might be too mild for such criticism. It's definitely more than neutral (2).

The first part talks about Amy and Matthew's relationship being \"a bit of a phony.\" The word \"phony\" usually has a negative connotation because it implies something isn't genuine or authentic. So that part seems negative.\n\nHowever, the second part says, \"but the film works in spite of it.\" The use of \"but\" suggests a contrast, meaning even though there's a problem with their relationship, the movie still manages to work. The phrase \"works in spite of it\" indicates that despite this issue, the overall film is successful or effective.\n\nSo, putting it together: There's a negative point about the relationship, but an overall positive sentiment about the film's success. I need to weigh these two parts. Since the negative part is about just one aspect (the relationship) and the positive part is about the entire film, which likely has more weight in determining the overall sentiment.\n\nAdditionally, the phrase \"a bit of a phony\" uses \"bit,\" which softens the negativity a little, making it not extremely negative. The positivity is stronger because it's saying the movie works despite this issue, which could mean there are other positive elements compensating for that flaw.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the sentiment isn't entirely neutral because there's both positive and negative. It's more on the positive side since the overall assessment of the film is good. But it's not extremely positive either; the negative aspect does take some edge off it. So maybe a 3 (positive) or perhaps a 2 (neutral). \n\nWait, but the user wants to classify how negative or positive the sentiment is. Even though there's a negative point, the overall statement leans towards positive because it's highlighting that the film succeeds despite this issue.

The phrase starts with \"yet another,\" which often indicates that something has happened multiple times before and maybe the speaker isn't happy about it. It's a bit exasperated, like they've experienced this before and aren't looking forward to it again.\n\nNext, there's \"weepy southern.\" I think \"weepy\" refers to something emotional or sad, but in a way that might be exaggerated or overly sentimental. So maybe the content is drama-heavy, which could be a turn-off for some people if they're not into that genre. \"Southern\" probably indicates the setting or the style of storytelling common in Southern literature or films.\n\nThen we have \"bore-athon.\" This seems like a play on words, combining \"bore\" (which means something is tedious or dull) with \"-athon,\" which often refers to an event or marathon, implying that it's long and perhaps tiresome. So \"bore-athon\" suggests something extremely boring.\n\nPutting it all together: The phrase uses negative terms like \"weepy,\" which could be seen as negative if the person doesn't appreciate overly emotional content, and \"bore-athon,\" which clearly indicates boredom or lack of interest. However, the exact sentiment can vary based on context. If someone is a fan of weepy southern stories, they might not find it boring, but in this case, the speaker seems to be expressing frustration or dislike.\n\nThe structure of the phrase is critical. Using \"yet another\" shows that this isn't the first time they're encountering such content and perhaps they've had enough of it. This repetition suggests a negative sentiment because they're clearly not enjoying the experience anymore.\n\nI should also consider if there's any sarcasm or humor, but nothing in the phrasing indicates that. It sounds more like a genuine complaint rather than a joke. \n\nSo, evaluating the options: 0 is very negative, which would mean extremely harsh words; 1 is negative. The words used are definitely negative, but \"weepy\" might not be as strongly negative unless paired with the bore-athon part. Since they're combining two negative elements\u2014emotional over-the-top content that's also boring\u2014it leans towards a more negative sentiment than neutral.\n\nI don't think it's 0 because there aren't any extremely harsh adjectives, just frustration and boredom.

It seems like someone is talking about Judd's characters and suggesting they should pick up a book titled \"Smart Women: Foolish Choices for Advice.\" The word \"ought\" implies some recommendation or suggestion. Now, the phrase \"durable best seller\" suggests that the book has been popular and successful over time. So, it's being recommended as something reliable or valuable.\n\nBut then there's \"foolish choices for advice.\" Hmm, this part is a bit tricky. On one hand, \"foolish\" could be negative, implying poor judgment in giving advice. However, considering the context, maybe it's referring to the book's content rather than advising someone else. The book might discuss women making unwise decisions, which isn't inherently positive or negative\u2014it just describes a subject matter.\n\nPutting it all together: The statement is recommending Judd's characters to read this book, which is a bestseller. Even though the title suggests some foolish choices, the recommendation itself is neutral because it doesn't express a clear positive or negative emotion. It's more of an observation or suggestion without strong sentiment.\n\nI don't see any words that clearly indicate positivity or negativity beyond the suggestion and the book's success. So, I think this leans towards being neutral rather than leaning either way.\n</think>\n\nThe statement recommends Judd's characters to read a popular book discussing women's decisions, without expressing clear emotion. \n\nAnswer: 2", 2, 1, 38.38707035701373], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

From the problem statement, 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 is neutral, 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive. So, I need to assess where \"it's not hateful\" falls on this scale.\n\nLooking at the sentence itself, it's a negation of something being hateful. The phrase \"not hateful\" suggests that whatever is being referred to isn't filled with hate. But does that make it positive or just neutral?\n\nI think about how people use such phrases. When someone says something is \"not hateful,\" they're often implying that while it might not be particularly positive, it's at least not negative in a harmful way. So the sentiment here isn't expressing any strong emotion, whether positive or negative.\n\nAlso, considering the structure of the sentence, there's no adjective that conveys positivity beyond the negation. There are no words like \"kind,\" \"nice,\" or other positive descriptors. It's more about stating a lack of negativity rather than affirming a positive trait.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since the statement doesn't express any positive feelings but also isn't negative, I think it leans towards neutral.

Sumptuous usually means rich, luxurious, or impressively beautiful. So that part is definitely a plus in terms of feeling. But then there's a 'but' which often signals a contrast or negative point coming up.\n\nThe second part is \"intellectually stultifying.\" Stultifying isn't a word I use every day, but I think it means making someone feel bored or less intelligent. It has a negative connotation because it implies that something is so tedious or simplistic that it holds back intellectual growth or interest.

The user wants me to classify it on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). Let's break down the text step by step.\n\nFirst, the text talks about Alain Choquart's camera work. It says his camera \"barely stops moving.\" That could be interpreted in different ways. On one hand, constant movement might create a dynamic feel, which can be engaging. But the next part says it portrays both \"the turmoil of the time\" and gives \"a perpetual sense of urgency.\" Turmoil suggests some chaos or difficulty, so that's leaning towards negative. A perpetual sense of urgency could mean something is always pressing or stressful.\n\nThen, the text mentions that the film takes nearly three hours to unspool, which I think means it's a long movie. The sentiment here shifts with \"is both funny and irritating.\" So there are two emotions: humor, which is positive, and irritation, which is negative. \n\nPutting this all together: the camera movement reflects turmoil and urgency, which might make the film feel intense or stressful. However, despite its length, it's also described as funny, adding a positive element. The combination of these elements makes the overall sentiment a bit mixed but leans more towards neutral because both positive and negative aspects are present without one dominating the other.\n\nI think 2 (neutral) is the right choice here because while there are both positive and negative points, they balance each other out, not leaning strongly in either direction.\n</think>\n\nThe text describes the film's camera work as intense and dynamic but also finds it irritating due to its length.

Let me break down the text first.\n\nThe sentence is: \"If jaglom's latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling, some of its repartee is still worth hearing.\" \n\nAlright, let me parse this. The first part says that Jaglom's latest work isn't his best\u2014it uses \"not... at his most sparkling,\" which I take as a slight criticism. But then it softens by saying that some of the dialogue or interactions (repartee) are still worth hearing. So there's a mix here.\n\nBreaking it down, the negative part is that it's not his best work. That could lean towards negative sentiment. However, the second part is positive because it points out that some aspects are still good enough to be worth listening to.\n\nI think the overall tone is more neutral than anything else. The sentence isn't overly critical; instead, it acknowledges both a downside and an upside. So while there's a slight negative in the first clause, the balance tips towards neutral because of the positive note at the end.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 (very negative) doesn't fit here because there's a positive aspect mentioned.

It starts with \"as it stands,\" which is neutral, just setting up the current state of things. Then it mentions \"some fine sex onscreen.\" The word \"fine\" here suggests that the sex scenes are good quality, so that's a positive point.\n\nNext part: \"and some tense arguing.\" Tense arguing implies conflict or drama, which could be seen as either negative or just a neutral observation depending on context. But in this case, it's presented as another element without any strong emotional language around it.\n\nThe last part says \"but not a whole lot more.\" This seems like the main sentiment here. It suggests that while there are some positive elements (the sex scenes) and some tense moments (arguing), overall, the content isn't particularly engaging or substantial beyond those points. The phrase \"not a whole lot more\" sounds a bit underwhelming, indicating that the speaker doesn't find much else to commend or criticize beyond what's already mentioned.\n\nSo putting it together: there are elements that could be positive and some neutral observations, but the overall sentiment leans towards not being very impressed or satisfied. It\u2019s not entirely negative because of the mention of \"fine sex,\" which is a plus, but the lack of other engaging content brings it down. Therefore, I think this falls into a slightly negative category.\n\nI don't think it's very negative (0) because there are positive aspects noted. It also isn't neutral (2) because there's an implication that more could be expected or desired.

Let me read the sentence again: \"when the precise nature of Matthew's predicament finally comes into sharp focus, the revelation fails to justify the build-up.\" Hmm, breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I notice that it starts by talking about Matthew's situation becoming clear. The word \"predicament\" suggests some kind of problem or difficulty, which might be neutral but could lean negative. Then it says the revelation (which is the clarification) doesn't justify the build-up. So, \"fails to justify\" implies that expectations were not met.\n\nThe phrase \"build-up\" usually refers to creating anticipation or suspense leading up to something. If the revelation doesn't meet this expectation, it often leads to disappointment. So the sentiment here seems negative because the outcome didn't live up to what was expected.\n\nLooking at the words used: \"fails,\" \"justify,\" and \"build-up.\" These words suggest that there was an anticipation or setup that wasn't met, which typically results in a negative feeling of dissatisfaction.

It says there's only one way to kill Michael Myers permanently, which is to stop buying tickets to these movies. The main point here is advising people not to watch more of these films.\n\nMichael Myers is a famous horror movie villain, specifically from the Halloween series. So, the context is about movies, probably in that genre. The phrase \"kill Michael Myers\" metaphorically means stopping his existence on screen by ceasing to support the films with ticket purchases.\n\nNow, sentiment-wise, this is expressing dissatisfaction or frustration towards these movies. By telling people to stop buying tickets, it's a negative opinion because it implies that the person doesn't think the movies are worth watching anymore. They might feel that the sequels aren't good or that Michael Myers' character isn't being portrayed well.\n\nI don't see any positive words here. The advice is against supporting these films, which indicates a negative sentiment. It's not neutral because it's giving clear advice against continuing with them. So, it's more than just negative; it's pretty strong in its suggestion to stop watching.\n\nConsidering the scale, 0 is very negative.

So, breaking it down.\n\nThe phrase starts with \"backhanded ode.\" I know that an ode is usually a heartfelt poem praising someone or something. But \"backhanded\" means it's given in a way that's indirect or insincere. So, this isn't a genuine praise; maybe even critical?\n\nNext part: \"to female camaraderie.\" Camaraderie is positive, meaning close friendship and unity among women here. But the fact that it's a backhanded ode suggests the praise might be sarcastic or not sincere.\n\nThen, it says \"penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship.\" This part clearly criticizes the man for not understanding women or friendship. Using words like \"little clue\" indicates he's ignorant or uninformed on these topics.\n\nPutting it all together: The text is describing a poem that's supposed to celebrate female camaraderie but does so in an insincere way.

The sentence starts by saying the story has plenty of chances for big action and suspense. That sounds positive because having opportunities for these elements suggests excitement or something engaging.\n\nThen it mentions that Director Shekhar Kapur provides these elements with \"tremendous skill.\" Using words like \"tremendous\" is clearly a strong positive adjective. It shows admiration for the director's ability to handle action and suspense effectively.\n\nPutting it together, both parts of the sentence are complimentary.

So, when someone says it's drab, they're expressing dissatisfaction or boredom about whatever they're describing.\n\nNow, considering sentiment analysis, neutral would be a 2. But since \"drab\" has a negative connotation, the sentiment isn't neutral. The question is whether it's just negative (1) or very negative (0). \n\n\"Drab\" doesn't express extreme negativity like words such as horrible or terrible. It's more on the mild side of negative emotions. So, I think it leans towards a 1 rather than a 0 because it's not extremely negative but still has a negative undertone.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other factors that might influence this. The sentence is short and straightforward, so there aren't additional context clues. The word choice clearly indicates dissatisfaction without being overly harsh.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment expressed here is negative but not very intense. So the appropriate classification would be 1.\n</think>\n\nThe text \"it's drab\" conveys a negative sentiment.

The text is: \"has its moments, but ultimately, its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites.\" \n\nFirst, let's break it down word by word. \"Has its moments\" \u2013 that sounds positive because it implies there are good parts or enjoyable times. So that's a plus.\n\nThen, the second part says \"but ultimately, its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut...\" The word \"curmudgeon\" refers to someone who is crabby or irritable, so maybe the main character or subject of the text isn't very likable. Then it goes on to say they don't make the cut for any list of favorites. That suggests that despite having some good moments, overall, the curmudgeon isn't memorable enough to be liked or placed among favorites.\n\nSo putting it together: there are positive aspects (\"has its moments\") but an overall negative assessment because the main character isn't making it onto favorite lists. The sentiment is mixed but leaning more towards negative since the ultimate conclusion is that they don't make the cut.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), 4 (very positive). Since there's a slight positive and a stronger negative, it might be between neutral and negative.

The text provided is: \"what makes it worth watching is quaid 's performance.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. It mentions that Quaid's performance is what makes it worth watching. The phrase \"makes it worth watching\" implies a positive recommendation because it suggests that despite any flaws, there's something valuable here\u2014specifically, Quaid's acting.\n\nThe key word here is \"performance,\" which refers to acting skills. When someone praises an actor's performance, it generally conveys approval and satisfaction with the work done. There are no negative words like \"bad\" or \"disappointing\" mentioned. Instead, the focus is on a positive aspect that justifies watching the show or movie.\n\nThe sentiment isn't extremely strong because it doesn't use superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"brilliant.\" It's more of a straightforward compliment. So while it's clearly positive, it might not reach the level of being very positive (4). Instead, it's moderately positive but leaning towards the higher end since it's about something that makes the entire experience worthwhile.\n\nI should consider if there are any hidden nuances or sarcasm, but in this context, the statement seems genuine and complimentary. There's no indication of mixed feelings; the sentiment is purely appreciative of Quaid's role.\n\nSo putting it all together: The text is positive because it highlights a good aspect that makes watching worthwhile.

It seems like something isn't very interesting when considered on its own. The phrase \"not very interesting\" suggests a neutral to slightly negative sentiment because it's pointing out that something lacks interest but doesn't express strong negativity.\n\nI should break down the key components:\n\n1. \"on its own\": This indicates that whatever is being discussed is being evaluated alone, not in combination with other things.\n2. \"it's not very interesting\": The main sentiment here comes from this part. \"Not very\" is a qualifier that softens the statement, making it less strong than saying something isn't interesting at all.\n\nNow, considering the scale:\n\n- 0: Very negative \u2013 This would be if there was strong criticism or harsh words.\n- 1: Negative \u2013 Slightly unfavorable but not overly so.\n- 2: Neutral \u2013 No clear positive or negative sentiment; just stating a fact without emotion.\n- 3: Positive \u2013 Favorable, but again, the statement here isn't positive at all.\n- 4: Very positive \u2013 Highly favorable.\n\nThe sentence doesn't show any positive aspects. It's pointing out that something is not very interesting. However, it's not overly negative either because \"not very\" suggests a mild lack of interest rather than something being terrible or awful.\n\nSo, considering this, the sentiment seems to be slightly on the negative side but not strongly so. Therefore, I would classify this as 1 (negative). But wait, could it be neutral? Because sometimes saying something isn't interesting can be seen as a neutral observation without any strong emotion.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. The phrase \"not very interesting\" does carry a slightly negative connotation because it's pointing out that the thing in question doesn't hold much interest. It's not neutral; it's expressing that there's a lack of interest, which is a mildly negative sentiment.\n\nSo I think 1 (negative) is appropriate here because while it's not extremely negative, it does express dissatisfaction or disinterest.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence expresses a mild dissatisfaction by stating something isn't very interesting.

Sentiment refers to the overall emotion or attitude expressed in a piece of text. Positive sentiment indicates happiness, satisfaction, or optimism, while negative sentiment shows sadness, anger, or frustration. Neutral sentiment is when there's no clear emotional leaning\u2014just factual information.\n\nLooking at the phrase \"please see previous answer,\" it seems like a request for someone to refer back to an earlier response. The language used here is straightforward and directive. There are no adjectives or strong verbs that indicate emotion. It doesn't express any happiness, sadness, or frustration. Instead, it's simply asking someone to look at something else.\n\nI should consider if there could be any implied sentiment. For example, sometimes even neutral phrases can have a subtle tone. But in this case, \"please\" is polite but not overly so, and the rest of the sentence is just providing instruction without any emotional charge. There's no sarcasm or other hidden meanings that I can detect.\n\nAnother angle to consider: could the context influence the sentiment? If this was part of a conversation where previous answers were negative, would it affect the sentiment here? But since the task is only about classifying based on the given text itself, external context isn't considered. So, sticking strictly to \"please see previous answer,\" I don't find any indicators of positive or negative feelings.\n\nAdditionally, the phrase doesn't express any opinion or evaluation. It's purely informational and serves a functional purpose rather than conveying emotion. Therefore, it falls into the neutral category because there's no positivity or negativity expressed; it's just a request to refer back.\n\nI should also think about similar phrases for comparison. For example, \"refer to the earlier section\" or \"check the previous point.\" These are all neutral and serve the same purpose without any emotional weight. So, applying that reasoning here makes sense.\n\nIn summary, after analyzing the text for emotional cues, considering possible implications, and comparing it with other similar phrases, I conclude that the sentiment is neutral.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 2, 46.468911689007655], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The task is pretty straightforward: they provided a sentence about a movie, and I need to figure out how negative or positive it is.\n\nFirst, I'll read the text carefully. It says, \"the film is so packed with subplots involving the various Silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film.\" Hmm, okay, so they're talking about a movie but comparing it to a TV pilot. Let me break this down.\n\nThe phrase \"packed with subplots\" might imply complexity, which could be seen as positive or negative depending on context. But then it says it feels more like a pilot episode than a feature film. That comparison is interesting. Feature films are usually standalone stories, while pilots are meant to launch a series and set up ongoing arcs.\n\nSo the user seems to think the movie isn't fully developed because it's too much like a TV show pilot. That suggests they expected something more complete but felt it was lacking in depth or coherence as a single film. The sentiment here is critical of the film's structure, indicating dissatisfaction.\n\nNow, looking at the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, up to 4 being very positive. The text isn't harshly negative; instead, it's pointing out that the movie doesn't meet expectations by feeling more like a TV pilot. That leans towards negative but not extremely so. So I would rate this as 1 because it expresses disappointment without using strongly negative language.\n\nI should make sure there are no positive aspects in the text that might bump it up to neutral or even higher. The word \"packed\" could be seen as a strength, but in this context, it's leading into a criticism about structure and not being a good feature film.

It starts with \"As comedic spotlights go,\" which sets the context\u2014this is about a comedy performance or something related to that. Then it says \"Notorious C.H.O. hits all the verbal marks it should.\" The phrase \"hits all the verbal marks\" suggests that it's delivering on its promises or expectations in terms of humor and dialogue.\n\nI need to consider the words used here. \"Hits\" is a positive verb, indicating success or meeting standards. \"All the verbal marks it should\" implies completeness and effectiveness. So putting it together, the sentence seems to be giving a compliment about how well Notorious C.H.O. performed in its comedic elements.\n\nThere's no negative language here\u2014no words like \"fails,\" \"lacks,\" or anything that would indicate dissatisfaction. Instead, it's affirming that the performance met expectations, which is a positive sentiment.\n\nI also think about the structure of the sentence. The use of \"go\" after \"spotlights\" might be indicating comparison or evaluation, but in this context, it seems more like an assessment rather than a critique. The overall tone feels approving and satisfied.\n\nSo considering all that, I don't see any negative indicators here. It's definitely positive because it's praising the performance for meeting its goals. Now, is it just positive or very positive? Well, while it's positive, it doesn't use superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"excellent,\" so maybe it's a moderate positive.\n\nTherefore, I think this sentiment would be classified as 3 (positive), not the highest level because there aren't strong adjectives to push it to very positive.

The first part talks about being full of detail about a man and his country. That suggests depth and thoroughness, which are generally positive traits. The second part says it's \"well worth seeing,\" which is a direct recommendation or endorsement, indicating positivity.\n\nI should consider if there are any negative words or phrases here. In this case, all the words are positive. There's no ambiguity that I can see\u2014no sarcasm or double meanings. So the sentiment isn't neutral; it's clearly leaning towards positive.\n\nIs there a possibility of it being very positive? Well, \"very worth seeing\" might push it to 4, but in this case, it's just \"well worth seeing,\" which is more moderate. Therefore, I think 3 is appropriate because it's positive without extreme language that would make it very positive.\n\nI should also consider the context. If someone says something is full of detail and worth seeing, they're likely recommending it or expressing satisfaction with it. That doesn't reach the level of being \"very positive,\" which might involve superlatives like \"excellent\" or \"amazing.\"\n\nAnother angle to look at is whether there's any comparison or context that could change the sentiment.

The text is: \"a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8\u00a01\\/2.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down what this sentence means. It says that the film in question is a \"mimetic approximation\" of \"better films.\" Mimetic approximation suggests that it's imitating or copying those better-known films. So, the phrase implies that while this film isn't as good as contempt and 8\u00bd, it's trying to capture their essence.\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment here: The use of \"better films\" indicates that the other movies are superior. By saying this film is an approximation of them, it suggests that it doesn't reach the same level but is trying to. This could be seen as a neutral statement because it's acknowledging the attempt without outright praising or criticizing.\n\nHowever, there might be a slight negative undertone because it's pointing out that it's just an approximation and not equal in quality. But I don't think it's strongly negative enough to warrant a 0 or 1.

Thumbs down usually means a negative opinion, so that's a clear sign. The phrase \"endlessly repetitive\" suggests frustration or irritation because something is happening too much. Repetitive scenes could be boring or annoying.\n\nNext, \"embarrassment\" adds another layer of negativity. Feeling embarrassed isn't a positive experience, and having scenes that cause this feeling can make the overall sentiment worse.

So the sentence is pointing out that death is expected, which might not be surprising but still could be seen as negative.\n\nThe phrase \"death is lurking around the corner\" has a negative connotation because it implies something sad or tragic is going to happen. The word \"spoil\" adds to this negativity, suggesting that death will ruin the story's progression or the enjoyment of the plot.\n\nBut wait, is there any positivity here? It seems like the focus is on the inevitability of a negative event rather than celebrating anything positive about the movie. So it's pointing out something inherently sad but not necessarily expressing anger or strong dislike. The tone isn't overly emotional; it's more of a factual observation that this element is present.\n\nConsidering the scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive. I think this sentiment is negative because death is often associated with sadness or tragedy. However, it's not extremely negative because the statement isn't filled with anger or strong emotion; it's more of a neutral observation that points out an expected negative element.\n\nSo putting it all together: the mention of death as something inevitable and spoiling things indicates a negative sentiment, but since it's presented in a factual way without extreme language, it doesn't reach the very negative (0) level. Therefore, I'd rate this as 1 (negative).\n</think>\n\nThe text discusses the expectation of death in a movie based on a Nicholas Sparks novel, which is generally associated with emotional themes. While the mention of death indicates negativity, the statement is more factual than emotionally charged. Thus, the sentiment is negative but not extremely so.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 2, 51.83074234100059], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence is: \"It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the words used here. Words like \"reduces\" and \"complexities\" suggest that something is being simplified, maybe too much. \"Bromides\" refers to trite statements, which isn't positive. Then there's \"slogans,\" which can be seen as repetitive or uninspired.\n\nNext, the sentence uses adjectives like \"preachy-keen\" and \"tub-thumpingly loud.\" These terms imply that the speaker feels the content is overly intense or insistent in its message. The use of \"makes you feel like a chump\" clearly indicates a negative emotion; feeling like a fool isn't positive.\n\nPutting it all together, the text seems to express dissatisfaction and frustration with something being too simplistic and overly aggressive. The overall tone suggests that the speaker didn't enjoy or appreciate what they experienced. Therefore, this sentiment is quite negative. Considering the options (0 very negative, 1 negative, etc.), I think this should be a 0 because it's strongly critical.\n</think>\n\n0", 0, 1, 26.382047848019283], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user wants me to classify the sentiment of a given text into one of five categories: 0 for very negative, up to 4 for very positive. So, first, I need to understand the text provided.\n\nThe text is \"me no lika da accents so good , but i thoroughly enjoyed the love story.\" Hmm, there's some informal language here with \"no lika\" and \"da,\" which might be intentional for effect or a typo. The user seems to express two main points: dissatisfaction with something related to accents and enjoyment of a love story.\n\nBreaking it down, \"me no lika da accents so good\" \u2013 that part sounds negative. They don't like the accents being good, maybe implying they found them unconvincing or off-putting. On the other hand, the second part is clearly positive: \"i thoroughly enjoyed the love story.\" That's a strong positive statement.\n\nSo, balancing these two sentiments, there's both a negative and a positive element. The user isn't entirely happy but also had a good experience with another aspect. Neutral might be the middle ground here, as neither sentiment outweighs the other significantly. \n\nI should also consider the intensity of each sentiment. \"Thoroughly enjoyed\" is quite strong, while the dissatisfaction seems more about a specific aspect (accents) rather than the overall experience. So maybe it leans slightly positive but not enough to be a 3. Hence, I'll go with neutral, which is 2.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses both negative and positive sentiments. The user does not like the accents but thoroughly enjoyed the love story. Overall, the sentiment seems neutral.\n\n2", 2, 3, 34.952079186972696], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

'", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of this text and classify it as 0,1,2,3,4. Let's break it down.\n\nThe text starts with \"despite its promising cast of characters,\" which suggests that there was some initial positive expectation because a promising cast usually implies potential for a good story or enjoyable experience. So right there, I might think maybe the sentiment isn't all negative.\n\nBut then it says \"big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes.\" The phrase \"loosely tied\" makes me think that the episodes or parts aren't well connected or cohesive. That could be a criticism because if things are too loose, it might make the story hard to follow or less engaging. So this part leans negative.\n\nNext, it mentions \"which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny.'\" The word \"only\" here seems like it's pointing out a limitation. It's saying that even though something is zany (which often implies fun or entertaining), it didn't translate to being funny. That's definitely negative because the expectation wasn't met.\n\nPutting it all together: There was some promise, but the execution didn't live up to expectations. The series is loosely connected and not as humorous as intended. So overall, the sentiment seems negative.\n\nNow, how negative? It starts with a positive note about the cast, which might suggest 2 (neutral) if that's the main point, but the rest of the sentence outweighs that positivity by pointing out flaws. The critique is more than neutral; it's definitely on the negative side. So between 0 and 1.\n\nThe text isn't extremely harsh, though. It's not using strong negative words like \"awful\" or \"terrible.\" Instead, it's more of a disappointed observation. Therefore, I think it's 1 (negative) rather than 0 (very negative). There's criticism but not extreme anger or disappointment.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative because while there was initial promise, the execution fell short by being disjointed and unfunny. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 44.57641496701399], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user wants me to classify it on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). Let's break down the given sentence.\n\nThe text starts with \"a technically well-made suspenser,\" which sounds positive because it compliments the technical aspects and suggests it's suspenseful. So that part is good, maybe around 3 or 4. \n\nBut then the tone shifts: \"...but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide.\" The word \"abrupt\" is negative, indicating something unexpected and possibly jarring. \"Drop in IQ points\" implies a decline in intelligence or quality, which is definitely negative. Adding that it's \"too discouraging\" emphasizes dissatisfaction, making the sentiment more negative.\n\nSo while the first part is positive, the second part strongly counters that with negativity. The overall sentiment seems to lean negative because of the criticism towards the end, especially since the negative aspects are described as too much and discouraging.\n</think>\n\nThe text starts positively but ends negatively, with strong criticism overshadowing the initial praise.\n\n3", 3, 2, 22.88059377501486], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The main point seems to be about execution being a flop, which right away sounds pretty negative. \"Flop\" is a strong word; it usually means something that fails completely. So that part definitely leans towards the negative side.\n\nBut then there's this exception mentioned: \"about six gags that really work.\" Gags working would mean those parts are successful, so that adds some positivity to the mix. However, the overall statement starts with \"but,\" which often indicates contrast or negation of something previously stated. So the main sentiment is on the negative side despite having a positive exception.\n\nNow, considering how negative it is. The word \"flop\" suggests a significant failure. It's not just slightly bad; it's a complete miss in execution. But then, out of maybe many gags attempted, only six worked. That might mean that while most didn't work, there were a few\u4eae\u70b9 (highlights). So the sentiment isn't extremely negative because some parts did succeed.\n\nSo putting it together: The main sentiment is negative due to the flop, but it's somewhat mitigated by the successful gags. How negative does that make it? On a scale of 0-4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive. \n\nIf I think about the structure, \"execution is a flop\" would be very negative on its own (maybe a 0), but with six good gags, maybe it's not as bad as a complete failure without any positives. So perhaps it's just negative enough to be a 1 instead of a 0 because some elements worked well.\n\nAlternatively, could it be neutral? Maybe if the negatives and positives balanced out more, but here the execution is called a flop, which is strong. The positive part is less impactful in comparison. So I think it leans more towards negative than neutral.\n\nTherefore, considering all this, I'd classify the sentiment as 1 (negative).\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a mainly negative sentiment with some positive exceptions, so it's classified as negative.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 2, 46.521207541023614], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me read the text again: \"not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream, it also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest.\"\n\nHmm. The words used here are pretty strong and negative. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, \"thoroughly formulaic\" \u2013 that means the movie follows a predictable pattern without any originality. That's definitely a negative point because it suggests the film isn't creative or fresh.\n\nThen, \"middle-of-the-road mainstream\" \u2013 this phrase usually refers to something that's average and doesn't stand out. It's not a compliment; it implies the film is ordinary and lacks uniqueness.\n\nNext, \"glossy Hollywood at its laziest.\" Glossy can mean superficially attractive but lacking depth, while \"laziest\" clearly indicates criticism towards the film being unambitious or not putting in much effort. So this part is also negative.\n\nPutting it all together: The text is criticizing the movie for being predictable, ordinary, andlazy. There are no positive words here; everything points to a negative sentiment.\n\nBut how strong is this negativity? Is it very negative (0) or just negative (1)? Let's see. The language used isn't extremely harsh, but it's consistently critical. Words like \"formulaic,\" \"middle-of-the-road,\" and \"laziest\" are all quite pejorative. There's no attempt to balance these negatives with positives; the entire sentiment is sour.\n\nSo I think this falls into 0 for very negative because the language is strong and all aspects mentioned are unfavorable without any mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\nThe text strongly criticizes the film using harsh terms like \"formulaic,\" \"middle-of-the-road mainstream,\" and \"glossy Hollywood at its laziest.\" These descriptors indicate a lack of originality, ordinariness, and criticism for being unambitious.

The use of words like \"flabbergasting\" and describing the child actors as convincing suggests a positive sentiment.\n\nI'm thinking about each word's connotation. \"Flabbergasting\" is very strong, indicating surprise in a good way. Convincing implies that their performance was effective, which is a compliment. The overall tone seems appreciative of the movie and its young cast.\n\nSo, on the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive.

The phrase \"little of interest\" suggests that mainstream audiences won't find much value in the film, which is a negative point.

However, sometimes \"very negative\" might require even stronger language, but here it's solidly negative without extreme words like \"horrific\" or \"disaster.\" \n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider the impact. The film is not just slightly disliked; it's described in a way that mainstream audiences won't find much value, which could mean a significant negative reaction.

The phrase \"director's cut\" usually refers to an extended version of a film, often considered more complete or definitive by fans. That might already hint at a positive sentiment because it's a sought-after version.\n\nNext, the text describes the film as \"a love song to the movies.\" Using \"love song\" metaphorically suggests affection and admiration for cinema in general. This is clearly positive.\n\nThen it says the film is \"more fully an example of the kind of lush, all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes.\" The words \"lush\" and \"all-enveloping\" are strong positive adjectives, indicating something that's rich, immersive, and perhaps even luxurious. Rhapsodizing means expressing enthusiasm, so the film is praised for its ability to create such an experience.\n\nPutting this all together, every part of the sentence seems to be complimentary towards both the director's cut and the film itself. There are no negative words or phrases that I can spot, which makes me lean towards a higher sentiment score.\n\nI should consider the scale: 0 is very negative, 4 is very positive. The text is glowing, so it's definitely in the positive range. Since there are no neutral elements and all descriptors are favorable, it likely falls into the highest category.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence is highly complimentary, using terms like \"love song,\" \"lush,\" and \"all-enveloping\" to praise the film.

The word \"suffers\" immediately stands out as a negative term. It suggests that something is not going well or is problematic.\n\nNext, \"timid parsing\" \u2013 \"timid\" means lacking confidence or courage, which isn't positive. So this part reinforces a negative sentiment.\n\nThe phrase \"sons trying to breach gaps in their relationships with their fathers\" talks about sons attempting to fix issues with their fathers. This could be seen as a neutral observation about an effort to improve a relationship.\n\nPutting it all together: The sentence is pointing out that something (maybe a book, film, or analysis) fails because of its weak approach to understanding the issue sons have with their fathers.

So I have to determine where \"less than fresh\" falls on that scale.\n\nThe phrase in question is \"less than fresh.\" Breaking it down, \"fresh\" generally has a positive connotation. It can mean something is new, clean, or of high quality. When someone says something is \"less than fresh,\" they're implying that it's not as good as it should be or could be. \n\nSo the sentiment here isn't extremely negative; it's more on the slightly negative side. The phrase doesn't use strong negative words like \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" Instead, it's a softer criticism. Therefore, I don't think it reaches a 1 which is just negative.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if \"less than fresh\" could be neutral in some contexts. For example, if someone is describing a product that's still okay but not the best, they might say it's less than fresh. However, in most cases, using \"less than\" before a positive adjective like \"fresh\" does imply something negative\u2014it suggests underperformance or deficiency.\n\nSo putting it all together: The sentiment isn't neutral because there's a comparison indicating something is lacking. It's also not extremely negative since the words used aren't harsh. Therefore, I think this falls into the negative category but not the most severe.

The word \"wreckage\" is definitely negative, implying that the movie is part of a group known for being poor quality or disasters.\n\nThen it mentions specific movies: \"battlefield earth and showgirls.\" I know both of these films are considered to be among the worst ever made.

That gives a sense of something engaging or exciting initially.\n\nThen it says \"before becoming mired in sentimentality.\" The word \"mired\" means stuck, so that's not good. \"Sentimentality\" can be a bit tricky\u2014it usually refers to being overly emotional or sentimental, which might not be negative per se but could be seen as a flaw depending on context.

Let's break down the sentence.\n\nThe sentence is: \"If the material is slight and admittedly manipulative, jacquot preserves Tosca's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the words used here. The phrase \"slight\" might imply that the material isn't very substantial or deep, which could be a negative point. Then it says \"admittedly manipulative,\" which suggests that the creator is being transparent about using manipulative techniques. Manipulation in media can sometimes be seen negatively because it implies an attempt to control emotions rather than present something genuine.\n\nHowever, the second part of the sentence talks about jacquot preserving Tosca's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera. \"Intoxicating ardor\" is a very positive phrase, indicating strong emotion and passion that captivates the audience. The word \"preserves\" here shows that jacquot successfully maintains this intense feeling in the material.\n\nSo putting it together, there are two aspects: one negative critique about the material being slight and manipulative, but a positive note on how the director effectively captures the emotional intensity. I need to weigh these against each other.\n\nThe negative parts might make someone think the overall sentiment is neutral or slightly negative, but the strong positive adjective \"intoxicating ardor\" leans more towards a positive sentiment.

The sentence is: \"It's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of Sarah and Harrison.\" \n\nFirst, let me break it down. The text mentions \"unsettling images\" and \"war-ravaged land,\" which are both negative terms. These words evoke feelings of distress, destruction, and conflict, so they contribute a negative sentiment.\n\nHowever, the sentence also says that these images are \"more potent and riveting than the unlikely story.\" The word \"potent\" usually has a positive connotation, meaning strong or effective, while \"riveting\" suggests something engaging or captivating. So despite the negative imagery, there's an appreciation for how powerful and compelling those images are.\n\nNow, I need to decide where this falls on the scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). The presence of both negative descriptors like \"unsettling\" and \"war-ravaged\" leans towards a negative sentiment. But at the same time, the appreciation for the impact of these images adds a slightly positive aspect because it's acknowledging their effectiveness.\n\nConsidering that the focus is more on the unsettling nature rather than praising the story, but there's also recognition of their potency. I think this might lean toward neutral because while it's negative in content, there's an element of acknowledgment of quality which tempers the negativity.\n</think>\n\nThe text discusses unsettling and war-ravaged imagery, which are negative, but also acknowledges them as potent and riveting, indicating some appreciation.

The user wants a classification from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, reading the sentence: \"If Welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two, he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way.\"\n\nHmm, so Welles is being referenced as someone who wasn't happy about a certain split. Then it suggests that if there's another split in the context of a movie by his great-grandson, Welles might not approve.\n\nThe words used are \"unhappy\" and \"probably wouldn't be too crazy with.\" The latter phrase seems to imply dissatisfaction or disapproval, which leans negative. But is it very negative?\n\nLooking at the structure: It's a hypothetical situation where something that made someone unhappy is happening again. The sentiment here isn't extremely harsh; it's more of a mild criticism or concern.\n\nSo, \"unhappy\" and \"wouldn't be too crazy with\" are both negative indicators but not overly strong. There's no extreme language like \"horrified\" or \"terrible.\" It feels more like a neutral to slightly negative sentiment because it's suggesting dissatisfaction without strong emotions.\n\nWait, but the structure is pointing out a similarity between two events that might have caused unhappiness. So maybe there's an underlying criticism of the movie for repeating something Welles didn't like.\n\nBut overall, the language isn't very intense. It's more of a neutral observation with a slight negative tilt because it points out a potential problem or continuation of an issue.\n\nI think this would be classified as 2 (neutral) or maybe 1 (negative). Since there's a clear expression of dissatisfaction but not strong enough to be very negative, I'll go with 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed is slightly negative due to the mention of dissatisfaction without strong emotions. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 41.026005356019596], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The main adjective here is \"mildly entertaining.\" The word \"entertaining\" has a positive connotation because it suggests enjoyment or amusement. However, the adverb \"mildly\" softens that positivity. So, instead of being strongly positive, it's just a bit entertaining.\n\nNext, looking at the second part: \"especially if you find comfort in familiarity.\" This phrase talks about finding comfort, which is positive, but it's tied to \"familiarity,\" meaning it's enjoyable because it's something familiar or predictable. This adds a slightly cautious note to the positivity because while comfort is good, the use of \"especially\" might imply that this entertainment isn't universally appealing\u2014it only works if you like what's familiar.\n\nPutting it together, the sentiment isn't strongly positive but leans towards being somewhat positive due to the enjoyment aspect. However, the use of \"mildly\" keeps it from being very positive or overly enthusiastic. There's no negative language here; everything is neutral or slightly positive.\n\nConsidering the scale, 0 is very negative, which doesn't apply. Negative (1) also doesn't fit because there's a positive element. Neutral (2) might be an option, but since \"entertaining\" is positive, even if mild, it should be above neutral. Positive (3) seems appropriate here\u2014it's not the strongest positive, but definitely leans that way.\n\nSo, I think the sentiment is 3\u2014positive.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 3, 36.863518340018345], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The word \"collapses\" is pretty strong and suggests that something isn't going well. It implies a failure or breakdown of whatever was happening before. So that's a negative indicator.\n\nNext, \"when Mr. Taylor tries to shift the tone.\" This part tells me that someone (Mr. Taylor) is attempting to change the direction or feel of something\u2014maybe a story, movie, or project. The attempt is to move towards a \"thriller's rush,\" which usually means adding excitement or urgency.\n\nPutting it together: Mr. Taylor tried to make things more thrilling, but the result was that whatever was happening collapsed. So his effort didn't work; instead, it led to failure. That seems like a negative outcome because the attempt didn't achieve its goal and caused a problem.\n\nI don't see any positive words here. The word \"shift\" could be neutral or even positive if it worked out, but since it resulted in collapse, it's clearly negative. There's no indication that this was a good thing; collapsing is bad.\n\nSo considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, etc. Since the main action (collapse) is quite strong and negative, I think this sentiment is on the more negative side but not the absolute worst case scenario. Maybe a 1 or a 0.\n\nWait, does \"collapses\" make it very negative? It's a significant failure. But is there any nuance here that might suggest it's just a minor issue? The sentence doesn't give any such context; it sounds like a complete breakdown. So maybe it's 0 (very negative).\n\nBut wait, sometimes in reviews or critiques, \"collapses\" can mean the attempt didn't work as intended, but perhaps the overall sentiment isn't as harsh as 'very negative.' Maybe it's just that the shift wasn't effective, leading to a negative outcome, which would be a 1.\n\nHmm. It's tricky. I think \"collapses\" is strong enough to indicate a significant problem, so maybe 0. But others might see it as a negative but not extremely so. Alternatively, considering that the attempt was made and failed, perhaps it's just negative rather than very negative.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative because the attempt to shift the tone resulted in failure (\"collapses\"), indicating significant issues.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 54.99085228898912], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Then they add \"but then again,\" suggesting they're weighing another possibility where it actually is history.\n\nThe phrase doesn't have strong positive or negative words. Words like \"may\" and \"what if\" indicate hesitation rather than a clear emotion. There's no overtly happy or sad language here, so the sentiment isn't strongly leaning either way.\n\nI need to decide between neutral (2) and maybe slightly positive (3). But since there's more doubt expressed than anything else, I think it's closer to neutral.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sentence seems to be pointing out something that's absent in \"it all,\" which is a moral. So the person is saying that despite everything present, there's a lack of a moral element. \n\nNow, thinking about the sentiment here. The use of \"missing\" indicates something is lacking. That suggests disappointment or dissatisfaction because an expected component isn't there. But how strong is this feeling? Is it very negative (0) or just negative (1)?\n\nThe word \"moral\" implies that perhaps in a story or situation, a lesson or principle was expected but wasn't found. The tone doesn't seem overly harsh; it's more of an observation than a strongly negative complaint. So it's pointing out a deficiency without extreme language.\n\nConsidering the scale:\n- 0: Very negative (e.g., \"This is terrible, I hate this.\")\n- 1: Negative\n- 2: Neutral\n- 3: Positive\n- 4: Very positive\n\nThe sentiment here isn't neutral because it's pointing out a missing element, which suggests some dissatisfaction. It's not extremely negative either; there's no strong language or explicit anger. So between 0 and 1.\n\nSince it's expressing that something is lacking but without intense emotion, I'd lean towards 1 (negative) rather than 0 (very negative). The person isn't happy with the absence of a moral, but they aren't using harsh terms.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to the mention of something being missing, indicating dissatisfaction.

Let's break down the given sentence: \"the film 's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify key words that indicate sentiment. The phrase \"darker moments\" suggests something negative or serious about the film. However, it says these moments are \"smoothed over,\" which might mean they're made less intense. Then there's an \"overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings.\" \"Tender\" can be positive, but paired with \"inspirational tidings,\" which sounds uplifting. But then it mentions \"especially in the last few cloying moments.\" The word \"cloying\" usually means overly sweet or sentimental, often in a way that's seen as insincere.\n\nPutting this together: The film had some dark parts, but they were softened by an excessive attempt to be inspirational. This approach might come off as too much, making the ending feel cloying rather than genuinely touching. So, while there's an intention to inspire, the execution is criticized for being overdone and perhaps insincere.\n\nConsidering sentiment scores: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The text isn't outright negative but points out that the inspirational aspect might be too much, leading to a somewhat negative or at least less than fully positive view.

The sentence is: \"Granddad of le nouvelle vague, Jean-Luc Godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek.\" \n\nFirst, let's break it down word by word. The subject here is Jean-Luc Godard, a well-known filmmaker associated with the French New Wave (\"nouvelle vague\"). He's being referred to as the \"granddad,\" which might imply he's an older or foundational figure in that movement.\n\nThe next part says he \"continues to baffle the faithful.\" The word \"baffle\" suggests confusion or puzzlement. So, it seems like his work is confusing some of his followers or fans (\"the faithful\"). \n\nThen it mentions \"his games of hide-and-seek.\" This phrase could be metaphorical, indicating that Godard's approach is elusive or challenging to understand. It might not be straightforward or easy to follow.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence seems to indicate that while Godard is respected as a pioneer, his recent work isn't clear or accessible to everyone, which might lead some people to feel confused or frustrated. However, there's no overtly negative language here; instead, it's more about the complexity of his approach.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 is neutral, 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive. The text doesn't express strong negativity or positivity. It's more of an observation that Godard continues to be enigmatic, which could be seen as neutral with a slight lean towards the negative because \"baffle\" implies confusion.\n\nBut wait, in some contexts, being confusing can also be seen as intriguing or thought-provoking, which might have a positive connotation. However, since it's specifically said that he baffles the faithful, it suggests that his followers are confused, which leans more towards a slightly negative sentiment without being overly harsh.\n\nSo, I think the sentiment here is slightly negative but not extremely so. Therefore, it should be classified as 1 (negative). But I'm a bit unsure because \"baffle\" isn't necessarily a completely negative word; it could also imply admiration for his complexity. Maybe it's more neutral? Hmm.\n\nWait, considering that the faithful are confused, it might indicate some level of dissatisfaction or frustration among his followers, making it lean towards negative.

The text is: \"the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key components of this sentence to understand its overall tone.\n\nThe phrase starts with \"inherent limitations,\" which suggests that there's something fundamentally flawed about using a video game for a movie. That already gives me a negative impression because limitations imply shortcomings or issues.\n\nThen it says these limitations are \"once again made all too clear.\" The repetition (\"once again\") indicates that this isn't the first time such problems have occurred, reinforcing the idea that there's a consistent issue here, which adds to the negativity.\n\nNext, the text describes the movie as a \"schlocky horror/action hybrid.\" The word \"schlocky\" is definitely negative. It means something that's of low quality or lacking in sophistication. So this is another layer of negativity towards the film.\n\nPutting it all together, every part of this sentence seems to convey dissatisfaction with the movie. They're pointing out the problems with using a video game as source material and then criticizing the film itself for being schlocky.\n\nI should also consider if there's any positivity or neutrality here. But looking at each word, they all contribute negatively: limitations, made clear again, schlocky. There's no positive spin; it's entirely critical.\n\nTherefore, considering the options (0 to 4), I think this sentiment is very negative. The text isn't just a little negative; it's strongly critical of both the approach and the outcome.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses strong dissatisfaction with the movie, criticizing its use of video game source material and calling it schlocky. \n\n4", 4, 1, 36.05966766900383], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

In this case, it's a short phrase, so I should focus on that.\n\nLooking at the words used: \"bad\" and \"company.\" The word \"bad\" is a clear indicator of negativity. It conveys dissatisfaction or something not going well. When someone refers to a company as bad, they're expressing a negative sentiment about that business, possibly regarding service, products, treatment, etc.\n\nSince there's only one adjective here\u2014\"bad\"\u2014and no other modifiers or context, I don't have any mitigating factors. There's nothing positive mentioned, so it can't be neutral. It's definitely on the negative side.\n\nNow, considering the scale from 0 to 4: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, and so on. Since \"bad\" isn't an extremely strong negative word but still clearly negative, I think 1 would be appropriate here. If it were something like \"terrible\" or \"horrible,\" maybe a 0 would fit better because those are stronger negatives.\n\nI also need to consider if there's any sarcasm or context that might flip the sentiment, but with just \"bad company,\" that doesn't seem likely. It's straightforward negativity without any nuances that suggest otherwise.\n\nSo putting it all together: The text is negative due to the word \"bad.\" It's not extremely so, so 1 makes sense instead of 0.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 1, 32.294746848987415], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The first phrase says that the Hollywood ending isn't \"show-stoppingly hilarious.\" That seems like a slight criticism because it's not as funny as expected or hoped for. So there's a bit of negativity here.\n\nThen the second part is \"but scathingly witty nonetheless.\" Now, \"scathingly\" usually has a negative connotation\u2014it means being sharp or biting in wit. However, when paired with \"witty,\" it might mean that while the humor isn't over-the-top hilarious, it's still clever and sharp. So this could be seen as positive because it acknowledges the wit, even if it's not of the highest intensity.\n\nPutting it together, the sentence is pointing out a flaw (not being show-stoppingly funny) but then mitigates that by saying it's still witty. The overall tone isn't completely negative because there's a positive aspect mentioned after the criticism. \n\nSo I'm thinking the sentiment isn't neutral because it starts with a negative but ends on a slightly positive note. It's not overly positive either, since the main point was that it wasn't as funny as expected. Therefore, the sentiment is probably leaning towards positive but not extremely so.\n\nI should consider the scale again: 0 very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. Since there's both a criticism and a compliment, with the emphasis on the wit being present even if it's not as much as hoped, I think it's more on the positive side but not the highest.

The main point seems to be about Snipes relying too much on a \"scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario.\" The phrase \"too much\" suggests that while it's using something effective, maybe even intense (\"scorchingly\"), the reliance might be excessive.\n\nThe word \"relied too much\" indicates that there's a criticism here. It could mean that Snipes is overusing this element, which isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself, but the problem arises because of the consequence: \"for its own good.\" So, doing something for your own good usually implies it's positive, but when you rely too much on it, even if it's good, it might not be beneficial. It could mean that while Snipes is using a strong dramatic element, over-relying on it might lead to problems like predictability or lack of depth in other areas.\n\nSo the sentiment isn't entirely negative because \"scorchingly plotted\" suggests that the scenario is intense and well-done. But the overall statement points out a flaw in relying too much on this aspect, which could indicate a mild criticism. Therefore, it's not very positive but leans towards being somewhat negative because of the critique about over-reliance.\n\nConsidering the scale from 0 to 4, I think this sentiment is slightly negative. It's not extremely negative because there's an acknowledgment that the scenario is well-plotted, but the reliance might be problematic. So maybe a 1? Or could it be neutral?\n\nWait, another angle: \"relying too much\" can sometimes imply that despite the element being good, overuse leads to issues. So if someone says a movie relies too much on its action sequences, they might mean it's good but not enough otherwise. Here, the scenario is described as scorchingly plotted, which is positive, but relying too much for its own good suggests that this reliance isn't helping, perhaps making the rest of the film weaker.\n\nSo overall, there's a critical tone here. The sentence points out a flaw in Snipes' approach. Therefore, it's negative. But how strong? Since it's pointing out a fault without extreme language, maybe 1 for negative.\n\nAlternatively, if the reliance is seen as a positive but overdone, it might be more neutral. Hmm.

Then there are two main points: \"a dearth of vitality\" and a story that's \"shapeless and uninflected.\" \n\nA dearth means a lack or shortage. So, lacking vitality suggests the movie isn't lively or engaging. That definitely sounds negative. The second part about the story being shapeless could mean it doesn't have a clear structure or direction, which is another negative point. Uninflected might refer to the storytelling not having enough emotional variation or interest.\n\nPutting this together, both points are pointing out significant flaws in the movie. Words like \"fatal\" and describing the issues as \"ailments\" emphasize that these are major problems. The overall tone is critical and unfavorable towards the movie.\n\nSo considering the scale: 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).

Next, \"in an increasingly important film industry\"\u2014that part seems positive because \"increasingly important\" suggests growth and significance. \n\nThe phrase \"and worth the look\" definitely adds to the positivity.

So each part adds up to a very positive sentiment.\n\nI don't think there's any neutrality here because all parts are leaning towards positive. There's no doubt or hesitation in the statement. It's straightforward in its praise.\n\nSo considering the scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, this should be on the higher end. I'm confident that it's at least a 3 or maybe even a 4. But since it doesn't use superlatives like \"excellent\" or \"incredible,\" but rather words like \"hallmark\" which are more about reputation and \"worth the look\" which is a recommendation, it might be a 3.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, considering the combination of terms: \"hallmark film\" suggests it's well-regarded, \"increasingly important industry\" adds value to its context, and \"worth the look\" is a direct endorsement. Maybe that does push it towards very positive. So perhaps it should be a 4.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again: \"hallmark film\" could sometimes be seen as formulaic but still positive. The industry being increasingly important adds context, and worth the look is a clear positive. Overall, this seems like a strong positive sentiment without any negative undertones.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is very positive, emphasizing quality, importance, and recommendation.\n\n4", 4, 3, 52.86038709900458], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The word \"campy\" can sometimes have a negative connotation because it suggests something that's overly dramatic or clich\u00e9. But here, it seems like the speaker is saying that even with this campy approach, Mel Brooks' style still comes off as sophisticated. So, maybe they're complimenting Mel Brooks despite the campiness.\n\nThe phrase \"borscht belt schtick\" refers to a type of comedy that's often associated with Jewish humor and can sometimes be seen as cheap or\u4fd7\u6c14\u7684. But by saying it \"looks sophisticated,\" the speaker is elevating it, which sounds positive. \n\nPutting it all together, the sentence seems to appreciate Mel Brooks' ability to make his style look good even when it's campy.

The phrase starts with \"two big things are missing,\" which immediately signals something is wrong or lacking. The first thing mentioned is \"anything approaching a visceral kick.\" A \"visceral kick\" suggests an emotional impact or excitement, and saying it's missing implies that the experience lacks this element.\n\nThe second part talks about \"anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all.\" This means there's no compelling reason for someone to endure whatever is being discussed. The use of \"even a vague reason\" emphasizes how lacking it is, suggesting that not only is there nothing good but also nothing minimally acceptable.\n\nPutting this together, both points highlight significant shortcomings. There's a clear dissatisfaction expressed about the absence of essential elements. The sentiment isn't just negative; it's quite strong because it's pointing out two major flaws without any mitigating positives mentioned.\n\nConsidering the scale, 0 is very negative, and 1 is negative. Since both issues are substantial and there's no positive aspect, I think this leans towards being more than just negative\u2014it's quite harsh. However, it's not as extreme as a \"very negative\" score because while it's critical, it doesn't use overly emotional language beyond pointing out the absences.\n\nWait, but maybe it is very negative because it's stating that two big things are missing, which could imply a strong dislike or disappointment. The phrase \"sit through it all\" suggests that the experience was unpleasant enough to make someone consider not sticking with it.\n\nI'm a bit torn between 0 and 1. On one hand, the sentiment is clearly negative, but I don't know if it's \"very negative.\" The user didn't use strong emotional words like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" just pointed out what's missing. So perhaps it's more of a 1 (negative) rather than 0.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses dissatisfaction by highlighting two significant shortcomings, indicating a clear negative sentiment without extreme language. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 47.52361099800328], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It seems like someone is talking about jokes being repeated a lot. The phrase \"at least\" might mean that every joke is told more than once, maybe multiple times. Then they use an em dash followed by \"annoying,\" which suggests that this repetition is irritating or\u70e6\u4eba. The question at the end, \"isn't it?\" is asking for agreement, so it's reinforcing the negative sentiment.\n\nNow, considering the options: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, and so on. I should think about how strong the negative emotion is here. The words used are \"annoying,\" which is a negative term, but it's not extremely harsh. There's no use of stronger words like \"horrifying\" or \"terrible.\" So maybe it's not the most intense negative sentiment.\n\nThe structure also makes me think that this isn't an extremely strong statement. It's more of a complaint than something filled with anger or deep sadness. The person is expressing frustration about jokes being repeated, but not in a way that conveys extreme negativity. \n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment is negative because they're expressing irritation, but it's not extremely so. Therefore, I would classify this as 1 (negative) rather than 0 (very negative). It's a clear negative sentiment without being overly intense.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses frustration about jokes being repeated, using \"annoying\" which indicates a negative sentiment. The tone isn't extremely harsh, so it's classified as negative.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 39.2947972099937], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The possible outputs are integers from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. The text given is: \"takes a simple premise and carries it to unexpected heights.\"\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, the sentence seems to be about something that starts with a simple idea but then does something surprising or impressive with it. The phrase \"carries it to unexpected heights\" suggests that whatever was done exceeded expectations or went beyond what was initially thought possible.\n\nI need to figure out if this is positive or negative. Well, when someone talks about taking a premise to unexpected heights, especially in the context of art, literature, or any creative endeavor, it's usually a compliment. It means they've added depth or complexity that wasn't obvious at first glance. So the sentiment here seems positive.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit because there are no negative words here. 1 is negative, but again, this isn't negative either. Neutral (2) could be a consideration if it's just stating a fact without emotion, but the use of \"unexpected heights\" implies approval or admiration, so it's more than neutral.\n\nBetween positive (3) and very positive (4), I have to decide which fits better. The phrase doesn't use superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"fantastic,\" but it does indicate a significant achievement in taking something simple to unexpected levels. That sounds quite favorable, so maybe 3 is the right choice. However, sometimes people might consider this as very positive because it's highlighting an impressive outcome.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I say a movie takes a simple premise and carries it to unexpected heights, that would usually be a strong compliment, indicating a very positive sentiment. So perhaps 4 makes more sense here because the phrasing suggests something beyond just positive\u2014it's about exceeding expectations in a notable way.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The sentence doesn't have extreme words, so 3 might still be safer. Alternatively, considering that unexpected heights could mean a significant positive impact, 4 is appropriate. Hmm, I think I'll go with 4 because the phrase conveys a strong approval and success beyond what was anticipated.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 4, 50.31843213099637], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Now, they gave another statement: \"the lively appeal of the last kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy.\" \n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, I need to understand what sentiment classification means here. The scale is from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). So, for each input text, I have to figure out how positive or negative it is.\n\nLooking at the example response of 3, which is positive. That makes sense because \"lively appeal\" and integrating thoughtfulness with comedy suggests a favorable view. The word \"appeal\" is positive, and \"ease\" implies that it's done well without much trouble. So combining thoughtful elements (which are usually seen as positive) with pasta-fagioli comedy\u2014I think pasta-fagioli is a type of hearty stew, so maybe that's being used metaphorically for something comforting or heartwarming in the context of comedy.\n\nSo putting it all together, the statement seems to be highlighting positive aspects. The use of \"lively\" and \"ease\" are both positive indicators. Therefore, the sentiment here is definitely on the positive side. Since the example was 3, I think this one also falls into that category because it's not extremely enthusiastic but still clearly positive.\n\nI should make sure I'm consistent with how I classify these. If the text had more negative words or critical language, it would be lower.

That sounds neutral or maybe positive because it's about someone striving for a goal. But then the second part is more detailed. It says he turned journalists into a publicity department. The journalists are described as hard-bitten and cynical, which suggests they were skeptical or jaded at the start.\n\nSo the man managed to change their perspective so much that by the end of the campaign, they became part of his public relations team. That seems like a significant influence or control he had over them. I'm trying to gauge whether this is positive or negative.\n\nOn one hand, it's impressive that he could turn even cynical journalists into supporters, which might be seen as a positive achievement. But on the other hand, turning journalists into a publicity department could imply manipulation or loss of impartiality, which might have a negative connotation.\n\nI need to decide if this sentiment leans more towards positive or negative. The text doesn't explicitly state whether this outcome is good or bad, but the context suggests that the man was very effective in his campaign tactics. Effective can be seen as positive, especially in a political context where winning over the media is a significant achievement.\n\nSo putting it all together, I think the sentiment here is positive because it's highlighting the man's ability to influence others effectively, even if some might see it as manipulative. Therefore, I would rate this as 3 (positive) rather than very positive (4), since there isn't an overtly enthusiastic tone.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 3, 40.029935077996925], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The first part says that a simpler and leaner approach was preferred. The word \"preferable\" indicates that the speaker didn't like the current treatment, thinking it could have been better. So there's a hint of dissatisfaction here.\n\nNext, the second part explains why: because being about nothing can be funnier than when it's about something. This seems to suggest that sometimes content with less structure or plot can have more humor. The phrase \"after all\" might be used to add emphasis or agreement, reinforcing their point.\n\nPutting this together, the sentiment is leaning towards negative but not extremely so. They're pointing out a flaw in the current approach by suggesting an alternative would have been better. However, it's not overly harsh; they're just stating a preference and a reason for it without strong negative language like anger or frustration.\n\nSo considering the options: 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit because there's no intense emotion here. 1 is negative, which seems appropriate as they are expressing dissatisfaction. 2 is neutral, but since they express a clear preference against something, that's not quite right. 3 and 4 are positive, which don't apply here.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment is best classified as 1 (negative).\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses dissatisfaction with the current treatment, preferring a simpler approach, and highlights that sometimes less can be funnier.

It starts by saying that something \"escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies.\" The word \"escapes\" suggests moving away from something, maybe a typical formula or structure. \"Precious trappings\" might imply that these elements are perhaps overused or superficial in most romantic comedies. So this part could be seen as critical or pointing out a common flaw.\n\nNext, it says the story is infused with \"very real, complicated emotions.\" The use of \"real\" and \"complicated\" suggests depth and authenticity. Complicated emotions often indicate a more nuanced portrayal, which can be a positive trait because it adds realism and complexity to the narrative.\n\nPutting it together, the text seems to critique typical romantic comedies for their superficiality but praises this particular story for its depth and emotional complexity.

Neutral (2) could be considered if it's just an observation without clear positivity or negativity, but I think the overall tone leans more positive due to the praise of complexity and real emotions.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment is likely 3 (positive), as it's highlighting a favorable aspect over typical fare.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is positive because it praises the story for its depth and emotional complexity. \n\n3", 3, 3, 37.798693921999075], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

However, the phrase \"a more graceful way\" suggests that while they acknowledge the harsh reality, they think a kinder approach could be taken in how this devastation is portrayed.\n\nSo, putting it together: The sentiment isn't extremely positive because there's talk of devastation and an implied criticism of current portrayals.

It's slight but rich in wisdom and emotion. So the overall sentiment seems positive. \n\nNow, thinking about the scale: 0 is very negative, 4 is very positive.

So the main point here is about a project that's expensive but only delivering certain aspects like special effects and weapons.\n\nFirst, I should break down the sentiment. The phrase \"millions of dollars heaped upon\" suggests a lot of money was invested. Then it says this should bring more rewards than just the mentioned techniques. So there's an expectation that wasn't met fully\u2014maybe implying that while some elements were good (spiffy bluescreen, stylish weaponry), they're not enough.\n\nThe word \"need to reap\" indicates that something is expected but perhaps hasn't happened yet.

This criticism implies dissatisfaction, which leans towards a negative sentiment.\n\nOn the scale provided, 0 is very negative and 1 is negative. While the sentiment isn't extremely harsh, it's still clearly negative because it's pointing out a weakness in the structure or content. There's no neutral or positive aspect here; it's purely about the storylines not being substantial.\n\nSo, considering all that, I would classify this as 1 (negative) because it expresses a clear dissatisfaction without being extremely harsh.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed is negative because the sentence criticizes the storylines for lacking substance. \n\nOutput: 1", 1, 0, 31.383251476014266], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

For example, if two employees deserve better treatment from their employer, that would imply that they're being treated unfairly.\n\nSo, considering the sentiment, this statement is pointing out a lack or a deficiency in what they currently have or are receiving. That suggests a negative sentiment. It's not extremely negative because it doesn't use strong language like \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" Instead, it's more of a mild criticism or disappointment.\n\nI should compare this to the given scale:\n- 0: Very Negative\n- 1: Negative\n- 2: Neutral\n- 3: Positive\n- 4: Very Positive\n\nSince the sentiment is negative but not extremely so, I think it falls under 1. It's pointing out that things aren't as they should be, which carries a negative connotation, but it's not overly harsh or intense.\n\nI don't think it's neutral because the statement does express a judgment\u2014it suggests improvement is needed. So it's definitely leaning towards negative rather than being indifferent.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 1, 38.28873343998566], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user provided the sentence: \"a rumor of angels doesn't just slip--it avalanches into forced fuzziness.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each number represents. 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. My task is to figure out where this sentence falls on that scale.\n\nLooking at the words used: \"rumor of angels.\" The word \"rumor\" can be neutral or slightly negative depending on context, but \"angels\" are generally positive symbols. So that part might lean towards a positive sentiment. But then there's a shift with \"doesn't just slip,\" which is kind of passive, and then it says \"it avalanches into forced fuzziness.\" \n\n\"Avalanches\" gives a sense of something overwhelming or sudden. \"Forced fuzziness\" sounds negative because \"fuzziness\" implies confusion or lack of clarity, and \"forced\" suggests it's unwanted or unnatural. So putting that together, the sentence starts with something positive but quickly turns negative.\n\nI need to assess whether the overall sentiment is more negative than positive. The use of \"avalanches\" as a strong verb makes me think the negative aspect is dominant here. It's not just a slight dip; it's a significant shift into confusion or chaos, which feels quite negative.\n\nAlso, considering the structure: starting with a positive concept but ending with a negative outcome. That might make the overall sentiment more on the negative side rather than neutral. The word \"forced\" adds to the negativity because it implies something is being imposed unwillingly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think this sentence expresses a negative sentiment. It's not extremely negative (which would be 0), but it's definitely leaning towards negative without being overly so. Therefore, I'd classify this as 1.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 0, 39.19012947101146], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase \"the film compels\" suggests that it has the power to hold attention, which is positive. Also, mentioning that Demme experiments and \"harvests a few movie moment gems\" implies that there are standout scenes or moments, so that's another positive point.\n\nBut then the sentence takes a turn with \"but the field of roughage dominates.\" \"Roughage\" here probably refers to parts of the film that aren't as good, maybe unpolished or less engaging. So this part is negative because it's saying that these weaker elements are the main focus, overshadowing the positive moments.\n\nPutting it all together: there are both positive and negative aspects mentioned. The positives include compelling moments and standout scenes, but the negatives point out that the majority of the film isn't as good. This seems like a mixed sentiment leaning more towards neutral because while there are positive elements, they aren't enough to make the overall sentiment positive. But since it's not entirely negative either, it's somewhere in between.\n\nSo I think the sentiment is neutral.

The first part mentions drug dealers, kidnapping, and unsavory folks, which are all negative topics. These subjects typically evoke strong negative emotions like fear or concern.\n\nThen, the second part of the sentence contrasts with that by saying \"the tone and pacing are shockingly intimate.\" Here, \"intimate\" can have a positive connotation in some contexts, but it's paired with \"shockingly,\" which might imply something unexpected. It could mean that despite the serious subject matter, the way it's presented is unexpectedly close or personal.\n\nSo, there's a mix here. The first part is clearly negative, while the second part introduces an element of surprise in how the story is told. I need to weigh these elements. Since the first part sets up the context with negative subjects, but then adds that the tone and pacing are intimate, which could be positive or at least neutral depending on interpretation.\n\nConsidering that \"intimate\" might not necessarily make the sentiment positive if it's just describing a style rather than an emotion. The overall sentiment isn't strongly positive because of the initial negative topics. It's more about balancing the negative content with an observation on the presentation method.\n\nTherefore, I think the sentiment is neutral but leaning slightly negative because the primary focus is on the negative subjects. So, I would classify this as 2 (neutral) since it doesn't lean heavily in either direction beyond a balanced view.\n</think>\n\nThe text discusses negative subjects like drug dealers and kidnapping but also mentions an intimate tone.

The next part is a bit tricky: \"not-nearly-as-nasty-as-it-thinks-it-is.\" So, the joke isn't as offensive or harsh as it was aiming to be.\n\nPutting this together, the review seems critical of the movie because it uses an old, unoriginal joke that doesn't live up to its intentions. The use of \"moldy-oldie\" is a negative term implying staleness, and saying it's not as nasty suggests it fell short of being impactful or edgy.\n\nSo, considering all that, the sentiment isn't extremely negative but still leans towards negative because of the criticism about the joke being old and ineffective.

Let me read it again: \"the best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and bertrand tavernier 's oft-brilliant safe conduct -lrb- `` laissez-passer '' -rrb- wears its heart on its sleeve.\"\n\nAlright, breaking this down. The text starts with talking about didacticism, which I think refers to teaching or instruction in a way that's meant to convey a moral or message. It mentions that the best kind of didacticism is one that has a strong sense of humanism. Humanism usually implies concern for people and their well-being, so this seems positive.\n\nThen it talks about Bertrand Tavernier's \"Safe Conduct.\" The phrase used here is \"oft-brilliant,\" which is definitely a compliment. So the film is being praised as brilliant. The next part says the movie wears its heart on its sleeve, meaning it's emotionally open and sincere. That's another positive trait.\n\nPutting it all together: the text is discussing didacticism in a favorable light, especially when combined with humanism. It then praises a specific film by Tavernier, calling it brilliant and heartfelt. There are no negative words here; everything points towards positivity.\n\nSo considering the sentiment scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, I think this should be a 3 or maybe even a 4.

That\u2019s a bit negative because it suggests something isn't fresh or original. Then \"shallow\" implies that the content is not deep or lacks substance. So this adds to the negative sentiment. The phrase \"cautionary tale\" usually means a story meant to warn against certain behaviors, which can be seen as somewhat negative depending on context.\n\nPutting it all together, the text seems to criticize the portrayal of gay men's lives in a way that's both unoriginal and lacking depth. This criticism points out flaws or shortcomings, so the sentiment is negative. However, it doesn't use extreme language like \"horrifying\" or \"awful,\" which would make it more severe.\n\nI think 1 (negative) fits because while there are criticisms, they aren\u2019t extremely harsh.

It starts by saying the movie has \"clever moments\" and \"biting dialogue,\" which sounds positive. Clever suggests intelligence or wit, and biting dialogue can mean sharp or impactful lines, so that's a good sign. But then it says, \"but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface.\" The word \"but\" indicates a contrast, so this part is probably negative.\n\nThe phrase \"not much lurking below\" implies that the movie lacks depth. It doesn't have much going on beneath the surface, which could mean it's shallow or not thought-provoking enough. Abstract surface might refer to the style or presentation being abstract but without deeper meaning.\n\nSo there are both positive and negative aspects here. The positives are about the dialogue and clever moments, while the negatives point out a lack of depth. I need to decide if overall this is more positive or negative.\n\nThe sentence starts with acknowledging some strengths but then criticizes what's missing. It doesn't seem overly harsh in its criticism. So maybe it's leaning towards neutral. But since there's both positive and negative, perhaps it's slightly on the negative side because of the emphasis on the lack of depth, which might be a significant flaw for a movie.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. I think this sentiment isn't extremely negative but has some criticism. So maybe it's a 2 (neutral) or 1 (negative). Since there's a notable criticism about depth, perhaps it's more towards 1.\n\nWait, but the first part is definitely positive, so maybe it's not entirely negative. The balance between positive and negative elements might make it neutral. Alternatively, if the negatives are more impactful than the positives, it could be slightly negative. I'm a bit torn here.\n\nLooking at similar examples: when a review mentions both pros and cons but focuses more on the weaknesses, it tends to lean towards negative.

The user has given me a sentence: \"a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie.\" My task is to classify the sentiment as 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), or 4 (very positive).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence and identify the key adjectives and descriptive phrases. The word \"smug\" comes to mind immediately. Smug usually means someone is self-satisfied in a way that's seen as irritating or overconfident. So this might carry a negative connotation.\n\nNext, there's \"convoluted.\" Convoluted suggests something is overly complex or intricate, often in a confusing or unnecessarily complicated manner. In the context of a movie review, convoluted can imply that the plot or execution was messy and hard to follow, which again leans towards a negative sentiment.\n\nThe phrase \"doesn't allow an earnest moment\" stands out. Earnest moments are sincere or heartfelt parts of a film, so if it doesn't let those happen without reminding people it's just a movie, this could be seen as criticizing the film for not taking itself seriously when it should. This might come across as mocking or dismissive, which is negative.\n\nPutting it all together: \"smug,\" \"convoluted,\" and dismissing earnest moments all point towards a critical view of the action-comedy. The reviewer seems to find fault with how the movie handles its tone and structure, suggesting it's more about style over substance or that it doesn't engage emotionally as it should.\n\nI need to decide if this is very negative (0), negative (1), neutral (2), positive (3), or very positive (4). The use of \"smug\" and \"convoluted\" are clear negatives. However, the sentence isn't extremely harsh; it's more of a pointed critique rather than an outright condemnation. So it's not the most severe negative but still carries a negative sentiment.\n\nI think 1 would be appropriate here because while there are clearly negative words used to describe the film, the overall tone doesn't seem to reach 'very negative.'

The main points are that \"fubar\" is described as \"very funny,\" which is clearly a positive adjective. That immediately makes me think the sentiment isn't neutral or negative. But then there's a \"but,\" which often introduces some contrast or counterpoint.\n\nThe second part says it's not always laugh-out-loud funny. Laugh-out-loud usually means extremely funny, something that causes uncontrollable laughter. So by saying it's not always that way, the speaker is tempering their praise. They still find it funny but perhaps not as intensely funny every time.\n\nSo putting it together, the sentiment starts positive with \"very funny,\" which would lean towards a 3 or 4. But the addition of \"but not always in a laugh-out-loud way\" softens that positivity. It's acknowledging some limitation without outright negating the funniness. \n\nI'm thinking about how to rate this on the scale. A 4 is very positive, so if the statement were all positive without any caveats, it might be a 4. But since there's a slight caveat, maybe it's more of a 3\u2014positive but not extremely so.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that \"very funny\" is quite strong, even with the caveat, perhaps it still leans towards very positive because the main sentiment is positive. However, the use of \"but\" suggests a balance between positivity and a slight reservation, which might make it a 3 instead of a 4.\n\nI'm also considering if this could be neutral (2). But no, the overall tone is still positive despite the caveat, so it shouldn't be neutral.

The task is to classify its sentiment on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context and the emotion conveyed here. The text uses the word \"bad\" twice, which immediately signals negativity. It's talking about something being bad in a way that isn't positive at all.\n\nBreaking it down: the phrase starts by emphasizing \"bad\" as the key term for describing \"bad company.\" Then it explicitly states that this isn't meant in a good way, reinforcing that the sentiment is negative. \n\nThere's no ambiguity here; both instances of \"bad\" are used to convey dissatisfaction or a negative evaluation. The structure of the sentence makes it clear that the speaker is highlighting something unfavorable about \"bad company,\" and they're not using any sarcasm or positive spin.\n\nConsidering the scale, 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, up to 4 being very positive. Since the text uses strong negative language without any counterbalancing positive terms, a score of 0 seems appropriate. It's not just slightly negative; it's explicitly so in a way that emphasizes negativity.\n</think>\n\nThe text clearly conveys a negative sentiment with the use of \"bad\" twice and explicitly states it's not meant positively.\n\nAnswer: 0", 0, 0, 29.817820724012563], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the words used: \"charming\" is definitely a positive adjective. It gives a warm, pleasant feeling. Then there's \"but slight,\" which introduces some contrast or maybe a minor drawback. The word \"slight\" could be interpreted in different ways depending on context. Here, it might mean that while the comedy has charming elements, it's not very strong or impactful. Alternatively, it could imply that the positive aspects are subtle but still present.\n\nSo, \"charming\" is clearly positive. \"But slight\" might temper that positivity a bit, suggesting that it's not entirely overwhelmingly positive. Maybe the comedy isn't as strong or significant as one might expect. But since \"charming\" is a strong positive word and only tempered by \"slight,\" I don't think the sentiment is negative at all.\n\nThe overall tone seems to be on the positive side because of \"charming.\" The mention of it being slight doesn't necessarily make it negative; it just modifies the extent. So, the sentiment isn't neutral either because there's a clear positive adjective used. It's not extremely positive because of that slight modifier, so maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nWait, but 4 is very positive. Is \"charming\" enough to be very positive? Or does the \"slight\" bring it down from being extremely positive? I think since it's described as charming, which is quite positive, and only slightly tempered by \"but slight,\" it's still on the positive side but not the highest possible.\n\nTherefore, considering that it's a charming comedy with a slight aspect, the sentiment is positive but maybe not the most enthusiastic. So, perhaps 3 (positive) instead of 4 (very positive). Alternatively, if \"charming\" is strong enough despite the slight modifier, maybe it's still a 4. But I think the presence of \"slight\" might lower it just a bit.\n\nHmm, another angle: in some contexts, \"but slight\" could be seen as negative because it's pointing out a deficiency. However, since \"charming\" is such a strong positive word, maybe the overall sentiment leans more towards positive than neutral or negative. So I think it's either 3 or 4.\n\nGiven that, I would lean towards 3 because while it's positive, the slight modifier indicates it's not extremely so.

The text is \"impeccably filmed, sexually charged, but ultimately lacking in substance, not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break it down sentence by sentence. The first part says \"impeccably filmed\" which is definitely a positive point. It means the film was well-made visually. Then, \"sexually charged\" can be seen as positive if that's what the audience is looking for, but sometimes it might have a neutral connotation depending on context.\n\nHowever, the second half of the sentence flips things around. \"Ultimately lacking in substance\" suggests that despite good visuals and maybe some engaging content, the film doesn't deliver depth or meaningful themes. That's a negative point because it implies the movie is superficial. Then there's \"dragged down by a leaden closing act,\" which clearly indicates dissatisfaction with how the film ends\u2014leaden meaning heavy or slow, making it feel dragged out and unsatisfying.\n\nSo putting it all together: positive starts but turns negative overall. The positives are about technical aspects like filming, but the negatives hit harder on substance and conclusion. Since there's a mix but the latter part is more critical, I think the sentiment leans towards negative. But since there were some positives mentioned, maybe not the most negative.\n\nSo on the scale of 0 to 4, 0 being very negative, and considering it's mostly negative with some positive aspects, it might be a 1. Alternatively, if I consider that the negatives are stronger, but perhaps not extremely so, 2 for neutral? Wait, no, because the overall sentiment is more towards the negative side.\n\nWait, another thought: \"impeccably filmed\" and \"sexually charged\"\u2014so positive descriptors. But then it's negated by \"lacking in substance\" and a poor ending. So maybe the negatives are stronger but not extremely so, making it 1 instead of 0.

Then, \"entertaining\" is definitely a positive word\u2014it means enjoyable and engaging. So far, that's two positive descriptors.\n\nNext part: \"stops short of true inspiration.\" This phrase seems to indicate that while the thriller was good, it didn't reach the level of being truly inspiring. \"Stops short\" implies a limitation or something falling just short of a higher goal. So this is slightly negative because it points out a deficiency.\n\nPutting it all together: The text starts with two positive adjectives and ends with a mild criticism. It's not overly negative but does point out that the thriller didn't quite make the mark as inspiring. \n\nSo, considering the scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, this sentiment isn't extremely positive because of that last part.

Then \"artificial\" suggests something feels forced or unnatural. \"Opaque\" implies that it's unclear or difficult to understand. So these first three adjectives are all negative.\n\nNext part: \"an interesting technical exercise.\" That seems positive because \"interesting\" is a good word, and a technical exercise usually means they appreciate the effort or skill involved.

The phrase starts with \"k 19,\" which I think refers to the movie \"K-19: The Widowmaker.\" Then it says \"stays afloat as decent drama/action flick.\" The key words here are \"decent\" and \"drama/action flick.\"\n\nThe word \"decent\" isn't overly positive or negative. It's more of a neutral term, but leaning slightly towards positive because it means something is good enough. However, it doesn't express strong feelings either way.\n\n\"Drama/action flick\" describes the genre without much emotion. So putting it together, the sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive. The movie isn't being praised highly, but it's not criticized either. It's just described as a decent example of its genres.\n\nI don't see any strongly negative words like \"bad,\" \"terrible,\" or \"disappointing.\" There are no positive superlatives like \"excellent\" or \"amazing.\" So the sentiment is probably neutral, which would be 2 on the scale.

It's talking about a movie called \"Trapped\" that has many tense scenes. But then it says these scenes are more distressing than suspenseful. So I need to understand what the sentiment here is.\n\nThe word \"tense\" can sometimes be neutral or even positive if it's creating suspense, but in this case, it's compared to being distressing. Distressing means causing anxiety or stress, which is negative. Suspenseful usually has a more positive connotation because people enjoy suspense in movies as thrilling or exciting.\n\nSo the sentence is saying that while there are tense scenes, they aren't doing what they're supposed to do\u2014create suspense\u2014but instead make the viewer feel distressed. That's a criticism of the movie's effectiveness in creating tension. It's not just neutral; it's pointing out a flaw.\n\nI should consider how negative this is. The word \"distressing\" carries a stronger negative emotion than something like \"uncomfortable.\" Also, using \"more...than\" structure emphasizes that distressing is the dominant feeling, which isn't good for the movie's intent of creating suspense.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment is negative because the scenes are more distressing than suspenseful. But how strong is this negativity? Since the focus is on a flaw in the movie's execution rather than an outright condemnation, I think it's moderately negative but not extremely so.\n\nLooking at the scale:\n0 - very negative\n1 - negative\n2 - neutral\n3 - positive\n4 - very positive\n\nThe sentiment is definitely negative because of \"distressing,\" but since it's a criticism of how tense scenes are handled rather than something extremely harsh, I think 1 (negative) would be appropriate. It doesn't seem to reach the level of 'very negative' which might involve stronger language or more explicit negativity.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other words that could tip the scale. The sentence starts with \"though,\" which can sometimes indicate a contrast but in this case, it's just setting up the comparison between tense scenes being distressing rather than suspenseful. There's no positive spin here; it's all about the negative aspect of the tension.\n\nSo after considering all this, I believe the sentiment is negative, so the score should be 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence describes tense scenes in \"Trapped\" as more distressing than suspenseful, indicating a flaw in creating suspense. The use of \"distressing\" conveys a negative emotion, and while it's critical, it doesn't reach extreme negativity. Therefore, the sentiment is negative.\n\n1", 1, 1, 53.829148509015795], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The task is to classify the given text into one of five categories: 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), or 4 (very positive). \n\nFirst, I'll read through the provided sentence carefully: \"Certainly beautiful to look at, but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic.\"\n\nBreaking this down, the sentence has two main parts connected by a conjunction (\"but\"). The first part is positive: \"beautiful to look at.\" This suggests that visually, whatever is being discussed (likely a movie or TV show) is appealing. However, the second part of the sentence shifts the tone. \n\nThe phrase \"not very informative about its titular character\" indicates dissatisfaction with how well the main character is portrayed or explained. The word \"informative\" here seems to be lacking, which could mean that the content doesn't provide enough depth or detail about the subject, making it less valuable for someone seeking deeper insights.\n\nAdditionally, the text mentions that it's \"no more challenging than your average television biopic.\" This comparison suggests that while it might look good, the content isn't particularly thought-provoking or complex. It\u2019s on par with typical TV biographies, which are often criticized for being superficial. \n\nPutting this together: The sentence starts positively but then introduces significant criticisms about depth and challenge. While there is a positive element regarding appearance, the negative aspects of lack of information and intellectual engagement might weigh more heavily in determining overall sentiment.\n\nConsidering the scale from 0 to 4, very negative to very positive:\n- 0: Very Negative (Strongly negative language)\n- 1: Negative\n- 2: Neutral\n- 3: Positive\n- 4: Very Positive\n\nThe text is mixed but leans more towards negative because while it's visually appealing, the lack of depth and challenge are significant drawbacks. The positives are overshadowed by the negatives in terms of substance.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this sentiment as a '1' (Negative), as the overall tone is critical despite the initial positive observation.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence starts with a positive note about appearance but criticizes the lack of depth and challenge.

The user wants me to classify it on a scale from 0 to 4, with each number representing different levels of negativity or positivity. Let me break down what I should do.\n\nFirst, I'll read the text carefully. It says, \"the storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome .\" Hmm, all these words seem positive. Words like \"skilfully,\" \"magnificent,\" \"breathtaking,\" and \"awesome\" are strong positive adjectives.\n\nI need to think about each part of the sentence. The storylines being skillfully woven together suggests that the narrative is well-crafted, which is a compliment. Then, the mention of magnificent swooping aerial shots indicates impressive visuals, making the scene breathtaking. Finally, the overall experience being awesome wraps it up as a positive experience.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 is neutral, 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive. The text uses multiple strong positive words, so I think it's more than just positive; it's very positive. But wait, sometimes \"awesome\" can be a bit subjective. However, in this context, it's clearly used positively.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment here is definitely leaning towards very positive.

The output should be an integer between 0 and 4, where 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 is neutral, 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the phrase. \"True-blue\" usually means something that's genuine or reliable, often used to describe loyalty. But in this context, it might just be emphasizing the color blue without any particular sentiment attached. The word \"delight\" is clearly a positive term, meaning joy or pleasure.\n\nPutting them together, \"true-blue delight\" sounds like someone is expressing satisfaction or happiness about something being true-blue. Maybe they're talking about a product, an experience, or a memory that brings them joy because it's authentic. \n\nSince \"delight\" is such a strong positive word and there are no negative terms in the phrase, I think the sentiment here is positive. It doesn't seem overly enthusiastic to be very positive (which would be 4), but it's definitely a good feeling, so maybe a 3.\n\nI don't see any neutral words here; \"delight\" leans towards positive. There's no sarcasm or hidden negativity that I can tell. So yeah, the sentiment is positive enough to rate as a 3.\n</think>\n\nThe phrase uses \"true-blue,\" which conveys authenticity, and \"delight,\" indicating pleasure.

Depending on context, this could be neutral, but combined with the adjectives used, it leans negative. \n\nThe words \"sappy\" and \"preachy\" are clearly negative descriptors. \"Sappy\" implies overly sentimental in an unappealing way, while \"preachy\" suggests that the message is too direct or moralistic, which some might find off-putting.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment expressed is negative. It's not extremely so (which would be 0), but more towards a 1 since both adjectives are negative without being excessively harsh.

The words \"sensitivity\" and \"inquisitiveness\" are both positive traits, indicating that the director is meticulous and emotionally attuned.\n\nSo putting it together: the sentence praises the director's thoroughness, sensitivity, and thoughtful approach, comparing him favorably to a respected filmmaker. This doesn't just sound positive; it seems very complimentary, which might lean towards \"very positive.\"\n\nI don't see any negative words here. Words like \"sensitivity\" and \"inquisitiveness\" are neutral on their own but in this context, they're used approvingly. The comparison to Truffaut adds a layer of admiration.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment is very positive, so I'd classify it as 4.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence compliments the director's thorough and thoughtful approach, comparing him favorably to a respected filmmaker.

That sounds pretty negative because it's talking about something harmful happening. But then, it says they \"stumble upon others even more compelling.\" The word \"compelling\" is positive, suggesting that there are other truths that are even more interesting or important.\n\nPutting it all together: the documentary is praised for being great and uncovering more compelling truths, despite addressing a negative event.

It seems to have two parts connected by a comma. The first part talks about \"puerile men dominating the story,\" and the second part says that \"the women shine.\" \n\nStarting with \"puerile men dominate the story\": Puerile means childish or immature. So, this is a negative description of the men in the story. Using strong words like \"dominate\" suggests that their presence is significant but not in a good way.\n\nNow, looking at the second part: \"the women shine.\" To shine usually has a positive connotation, implying that the women stand out or excel in some way. This part seems to be highlighting something good about the women.\n\nSo, the sentence contrasts two elements: negative portrayal of men and positive portrayal of women. The structure uses \"while,\" which sets up a contrast between the two ideas. It's saying that despite the men being childish and dominant, the women are the bright spots.\n\nIn sentiment analysis, we look at the overall tone. Here, there's a mix of both negative and positive elements. But which one is more emphasized? The sentence starts with a negative point but ends on a positive note about the women. \n\nThe phrase \"the women shine\" might carry more weight because it's highlighting their positive qualities in contrast to the men's negatives. So, overall, the sentiment leans towards positive rather than neutral or negative.\n\nConsidering the options: 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), 4 (very positive). The text isn't extremely negative because it balances with a positive aspect about women. It's also not neutral since there are clear sentiments expressed.

It mentions that something has humor, characterization, poignancy, and intelligence, but it's comparing them all to a \"bad sitcom.\" So, each of these qualities\u2014humor, etc.\u2014is being said to be like what you'd find in a bad sitcom. \n\nNow, I know that sitcoms can vary in quality. A good one is usually praised for being funny, well-written, and relatable. But when it's called a \"bad sitcom,\" that implies the humor isn't funny, the characterization might be flat or clich\u00e9, the poignancy could feel forced instead of heartfelt, and the intelligence might be lacking\u2014maybe it's just shallow or doesn't make much sense.\n\nSo, putting this together, the text is saying that whatever is being discussed (maybe a show, movie, or book) has these elements, but they're not good. They are comparable to a bad sitcom, which isn't a compliment. Therefore, the sentiment here is negative because it's pointing out flaws by comparing them to something generally considered poor quality.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, and so on. Since the comparison is directly stating that these qualities are like those of a bad sitcom, which is quite negative, I think this falls into the negative category. But how strong is that negativity? It's not extremely harsh; it's more of a criticism but not overly abusive. So maybe 1 for negative rather than 0 for very negative.\n\nWait, but another perspective: using \"bad sitcom\" might be a common way to express dislike, so perhaps it's quite negative. But I don't think the sentiment is that extreme because it doesn't use stronger language like \"awful\" or \"terrible.\" It just states it's like a bad sitcom, which is a criticism but not super harsh.\n\nHmm, maybe 1 is appropriate here since it's clearly negative but not extremely so.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative because it compares various elements to those of a bad sitcom, indicating dissatisfaction.

The use of strong language like \"disjointed\" and assigning blame makes me think it's more than just slightly negative.

It starts with \"isn't a great movie,\" which seems negative. That part is saying it's not excellent. But then there's a\u8f6c\u6298\u8fde\u8bcd \"but\" which often signals a contrast. The second part says \"it's a perfectly acceptable widget.\" Now, \"acceptable\" isn't very strong\u2014it's more neutral than positive or negative. So the sentiment here might be mixed but leaning toward a middle ground.\n\nI'm thinking about the overall tone. The first part is slightly negative, acknowledging that it's not great. But then it balances that by saying it's still acceptable. So maybe the speaker isn't thrilled but doesn't hate it either. That sounds like neutral territory rather than clearly positive or more negative.\n\nAlso, considering context, \"widget\" might be a metaphor here for something else, but regardless, the key words are \"isn't great\" and \"acceptable.\" The first part is mild negativity, the second is neutrality. So combining them, I think the sentiment isn't strongly negative or positive. It's more of an average assessment.\n\nI don't see any superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"terrible,\" which would push it towards 4 or 0. Instead, it's using moderate language.

The sentence is: \"Until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the words used. Words like \"perceptive\" usually have a positive connotation because they suggest insight or understanding. The phrase \"two families in crisis\" sounds negative, but it's describing the subject rather than expressing an opinion about it.\n\nThe sentence mentions two girls whose friendship is \"severely tested.\" That sounds pretty tough and could indicate negativity, especially since it's due to bad luck and immaturity. However, the overall tone doesn't seem overly harsh; it's more observational.\n\nThe use of \"until its final minutes\" might imply that there's a resolution or some positive outcome towards the end, which could balance out the negative elements mentioned earlier. \n\nPutting it all together, while there are challenging aspects described (crisis, tested friendship), the language is neutral and descriptive rather than overtly negative or positive.

It suggests that the approach is straightforward, maybe raw or unpolished, which in some contexts can be seen as a positive because it's authentic or energetic. \n\nPutting it all together: The film is described as clever and insightful with an authentic, no-frills approach. This seems to be a positive assessment overall.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. Even \"quick and dirty\" isn't necessarily negative in this context\u2014it might even imply that the film is fast-paced or bold. \n\nSo considering all that, the sentiment should lean towards positive but not extremely so.

It mentions a \"psychic journey,\" which sounds like it's about an introspective or deeper exploration. \"Deep into the very fabric\" suggests something fundamental or essential. The subject here is \"iranian life.\" \n\nNow, considering each part: \"psychic journey\" isn't inherently positive or negative; it's more about depth. \"Very fabric of iranian life\" implies looking at core aspects, but without specific adjectives, it's neutral. There are no clearly positive words like \"joyful\" or negative ones like \"tragedy.\" \n\nI should also think about context. Without additional information, it's hard to tell if this journey is highlighting good or bad aspects of Iranian life. It could be exploring cultural elements, which might lean towards a neutral sentiment. \n\nSo putting it all together, the text doesn't express strong emotions either way.

The text in question is: \"this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to understand its components. The phrase starts with \"this real-life Hollywood fairy-tale.\" Using \"fairy-tale\" suggests a story that's idealized or perhaps even magical, which can be seen as positive. The word \"real-life\" adds an element of authenticity, which could make it more relatable and thus more appealing.\n\nNext, the sentence continues with \"is more engaging than the usual fantasies Hollywood produces.\" Here, \"more engaging\" is a clear positive adjective indicating that this particular fairy-tale is better or more captivating compared to others. The comparison to \"the usual fantasies\" implies that while Hollywood often creates fantastical stories, this one stands out as being particularly engaging.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment expressed is positive because the text praises the subject by stating it's more engaging than typical offerings in Hollywood. There's no negative language used; instead, it highlights the standout quality of this fairy-tale.\n\nConsidering the scale:\n- 0 and 1 are too negative for this context.\n- 2 (neutral) doesn't fit because the statement is clearly positive.\n- 3 is a solid choice as it's positive but not extremely so.\n- 4 would imply an extremely positive sentiment, but while the text is positive, it doesn't use superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"incredible.\"\n\nTherefore, the sentiment is positive but not overly so.

It says \"the best thing I can say\" which might indicate that it's not entirely positive because they're only able to find one good point. Then, the part about waiting for the director's next work could be seen as a compliment, showing anticipation or excitement for future projects.\n\nI should consider the context. The phrase \"can't wait\" is usually positive, expressing eagerness. So even though it starts with a somewhat negative framing (\"the best thing\"), the overall sentiment leans towards positive because of the expressed anticipation and support for the director.\n\nLooking at similar examples I've encountered before, when someone mentions looking forward to a director's next work, it often indicates that they appreciate their style or past contributions. So despite not gushing about the film itself, the positive outlook on future projects suggests a positive sentiment overall.\n\nI think assigning this a 3 (positive) makes sense because while there isn't an outright compliment on the current film, the anticipation for more work from the director is a clear positive indicator.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence expresses anticipation and support for the director's future work, indicating a positive sentiment despite not being overly enthusiastic about the current film. \n\n3", 3, 4, 31.581296188989654], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The subject here is Mr. Murray, who's making his debut as a filmmaker. He's known for directing music videos, which are usually shorter and have different pacing compared to full-length films.\n\nThe phrase \"as is often the case\" suggests that the author is pointing out a common problem with first-time filmmakers who are ambitious and eager. So maybe they tend to overdo something.\n\nNext part: \"Mr. Murray... stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold.\" The word \"stuffs\" here seems negative because it implies forcing too much into something, which probably isn't a good thing in filmmaking. Too much plot could mean the story is overcrowded, making it hard to follow or enjoy.\n\nPutting it all together: The sentence is talking about Mr. Murray's debut film having too much plot, which is a criticism rather than praise. It suggests that his eagerness led him to include more elements than necessary, potentially harming the film's quality.\n\nSo considering the options, 0 is very negative, which might be too strong here because while it's critical, it doesn't seem overly harsh. The sentiment is more on the negative side but not extremely so. Therefore, I think a 1 (negative) would fit best.\n</think>\n\nThe text critiques Mr. Murray for overloading his debut film with excessive plot, indicating a negative sentiment.\n\nOutput: 1", 1, 1, 39.3035839299846], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts with \"at its best,\" which suggests that whatever is being discussed is at its peak performance or most favorable state. That already hints at a positive sentiment because it's highlighting the best aspect.\n\nNext, the comparison to \"Black Hawk Down.\" Now, \"Black Hawk Down\" is a well-known movie that's both intense and highly regarded for its storytelling and action. It's not just any movie; it's one that people often praise. So comparing something positively to this film would imply that the subject being discussed is of high quality or has similar positive attributes.\n\nThen there's \"with more heart.\" The word \"heart\" here probably refers to emotional depth, passion, or sincerity. Adding \"more heart\" suggests an improvement over the original comparison. It's saying that whatever is being talked about not only matches the high standard set by \"Black Hawk Down\" but adds something extra in terms of emotion or depth.\n\nPutting it all together: The phrase is highlighting the best aspect of something, comparing it favorably to a respected movie, and adding that it has even more emotional depth. That sounds very positive. \n\nI should also consider if there's any negative undertone here. The structure doesn't suggest any criticism; instead, it's purely complimentary. There are no words like \"but,\" \"however,\" or anything that would indicate a downside.\n\nSo, considering all this, the sentiment is strongly positive. It goes beyond just being good by adding depth and emotional value, which makes me think it's more than just positive\u2014it's very positive.

The phrase starts with \"deep intelligence,\" which sounds positive because intelligence is generally viewed as a good trait. Then there's \"warm, enveloping affection.\" Warm and affectionate are definitely positive adjectives. The verb \"breathe out\" gives it a sense of something flowing naturally and positively.\n\nPutting that together, the text seems to express admiration or appreciation for something (maybe a movie or a piece of art) because it conveys both intelligence and affection.

The phrase \"if you have nothing better to do\" suggests that the person is implying there's a lack of other activities worth doing. It's somewhat dismissive of the movie, indicating it's only worth watching when there's no better option.\n\nThe mention of 94 minutes adds context about the time investment required. Phrasing it as \"nothing better to do with 94 minutes\" implies that the time might be better spent elsewhere. This could mean the reviewer doesn't think the movie is particularly engaging or valuable, so they wouldn't recommend spending time on it unless there's no alternative.\n\nLooking for sentiment indicators, words like \"nothing better\" have a negative connotation. The overall tone seems to express mild dissatisfaction or indifference towards the movie. It's not a strong endorsement but rather a lukewarm suggestion that isn't very positive.\n\nI don't see any overtly negative language, so it's not extremely negative (which would be 0). However, it's not neutral either because the implication is that there are better ways to spend time. So, it leans more towards being negative than neutral.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment should be classified as 1, which stands for negative.\n</think>\n\nThe statement suggests a lack of enthusiasm or interest in watching \"Clockstoppers,\" implying it's only worth considering when no better options are available.

The sentence is talking about his latest work.\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment words: \"dumb down.\" That doesn't sound positive. To dumb down usually means making something simpler or less intelligent, often in a negative way. So the speaker is criticizing Adam Sandler for trying to make content that's not very smart or sophisticated.\n\nPutting it together, the sentence is expressing a negative opinion about his latest work. It suggests that Adam Sandler is lowering the quality by making things too simple or lacking depth. That would lean towards a negative sentiment.\n\nHow strong is this negativity? The use of \"latest attempt\" adds a bit of frustration, maybe implying he's done this before and it's not improving. So it's not just a slight criticism but more of a stronger negative feeling.\n\nSo on the scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative, I think this would be at least a 0 or 1.

The user is talking about a soundtrack being so good that it's worth paying for just that part. \"Worth the price\" indicates satisfaction or value. Words like \"alone\" suggest that even without considering other aspects, the soundtrack is enough on its own. That's a strong positive statement.\n\nI think this is very positive because the user is highlighting how much they appreciate the soundtrack. There are no negative words here; instead, it's all about the positive experience the music provides. So, I should rate this higher than neutral or positive but not extremely high.

The word \"stinker\" stands out\u2014it's a strong negative term.\n2. Words like \"brazen\" suggest audacity in attempting something they shouldn't have, which implies criticism.\n3. \"Attempt to pass... off as a scary movie\" indicates disappointment that it didn't meet expectations.\n\nThe overall tone is clearly negative.

It's strongly negative but not extremely so\u2014perhaps a 1. But wait, \"brazen enough to attempt\" adds another layer of criticism, making it even stronger. Maybe it's closer to very negative (0). However, sometimes in sentiment analysis, \"very negative\" might be reserved for more extreme language. Here, the user is clearly frustrated but not using the most intense terms possible.\n\nI think the sentiment here leans towards a 1, as it's definitely negative without being extremely so.

It says the movie is \"critic-proof,\" which usually means critics can't find much to dislike about it. But the reason given is that it \"aims so low.\" Aiming low often implies that the expectations or goals are set very low, perhaps suggesting that the movie isn't ambitious.\n\nSo, putting that together, the sentiment seems negative because the movie doesn't aim high enough, which could mean it's not good but at least it avoids criticism. However, the term \"critic-proof\" might be a bit confusing because on one hand, it's hard to criticize, but the reason given is that it doesn't aim high, which isn't necessarily a compliment.\n\nI think the overall sentiment here is negative because aiming low suggests the movie isn't trying much and therefore isn't excellent. It's not explicitly calling the movie bad, but it's pointing out its lack of ambition as a reason for being critic-proof. So, I would rate this as 1 (negative) because while it's not overly harsh, it does imply that the movie doesn't reach higher standards.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 1, 28.91761599201709], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

So this part is positive.\n\nNext, it says \"the way young japanese live now.\" This is neutral; it's just stating what the subject is about without any emotional language yet.\n\nThen comes the phrase \"chafing against their culture 's manic mix...\" The word \"chafing\" implies some level of discomfort or irritation. So that introduces a negative sentiment here because chafing means there's friction or difficulty in dealing with something.\n\nThe rest describes the culture as having \"millennial brusqueness and undying, traditional politesse.\" \"Brusqueness\" is abruptness or rudeness, which can be seen negatively, while \"undying politesse\" refers to enduring politeness. Politesse is generally positive, but in this context, it's contrasted with brusqueness, so the overall culture might feel conflicting or challenging for the young Japanese.\n\nPutting it all together: The sentence starts positively by praising Hashiguchi's portrayal but then moves into describing a situation where young people are uncomfortable due to their culture's conflicting traits. So there's both positive and negative elements here.\n\nThe positive aspect is about capturing life vividly, while the negative is the struggle or discomfort felt by the young Japanese. The balance between these could lean towards neutral since it's presenting both sides without an overly strong emotion either way.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the words: \"very capable\" sounds positive because it's praising someone as skilled or efficient. That's a plus. Then there's \"nailbiter,\" which usually means something intense or suspenseful, often used in contexts like movies or sports where the outcome is uncertain and keeps people on edge.\n\nPutting them together, \"a very capable nailbiter\" could be describing something that's both skillfully done and thrillingly tense. Maybe a performance or an event that was intense but well-executed. The use of \"very capable\" definitely adds a positive spin to it, suggesting that despite the intensity (\"nailbiter\"), things were handled well.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. Both parts seem to contribute positively: capability and excitement. So, the sentiment is positive. How positive? It's not extremely so because while \"very capable\" is strong, \"nailbiter\" could imply some stress or tension, but in this context, it seems more about being gripping rather than negative.\n\nSo on a scale of 0 to 4, I'd say it's a 3. Positive without being overly enthusiastic.\n</think>\n\nThe text combines praise (\"very capable\") with excitement (\"nailbiter\"), indicating a positive sentiment without extreme enthusiasm.\n\n3", 3, 3, 29.95263552601682], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It's just in the middle. So, this part leans towards a 2 or maybe a 1 depending on how the rest of the sentence balances out.\n\nNext, it mentions an action film, which is neutral unless there are adjectives attached to it. Here, it's simply described as \"action,\" so no sentiment from that part alone.\n\nThen comes \"benefits from several funny moments supplied by Epps.\" The words \"benefits\" and \"funny moments\" are positive indicators. It suggests that despite being average, the film has some enjoyable elements because of Epps' contributions. This definitely adds a positive spin to the overall sentiment.\n\nPutting it all together: The film is described as average (neutral), but with positive funny moments. So, even though it's not outstanding, the presence of humor makes it more appealing than just being average. Therefore, I think this leans towards a neutral to slightly positive sentiment. Since \"average\" is 2 and the positive elements add a bit more, maybe it moves up to a 3, which is positive.\n\nWait, but sometimes when people say something is average with some positives, they might not rate it as high as very positive. So perhaps it's still neutral but leaning towards positive. However, given that \"average\" is a neutral starting point and the funny moments add a positive aspect without making the whole film stand out, I think it's better to go with 3 because the presence of humor makes the overall experience more enjoyable than just being neutral.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 2, 39.2722481849778], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence is: \"elling builds gradually until you feel fully embraced by this gentle comedy.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the words here. \"Gentle\" usually has a positive connotation, suggesting something kind or soft. Then there's \"comedy,\" which typically is associated with humor and happiness. So right off the bat, those are positive words.\n\nThe sentence also says that the feeling builds up until you're fully embraced by this gentle comedy. The word \"embrace\" here feels welcoming and positive. It suggests a sense of comfort or being enveloped in something pleasant.\n\nPutting it all together, the overall tone seems to be positive because of the use of words like \"gentle,\" \"comedy,\" and \"embrace.\" There's no negative language present, so I don't think it's neutral or negative. It might not be extremely enthusiastic, but it's definitely a positive sentiment.\n\nSo, on the scale from 0 to 4, where 4 is very positive, this would likely fall under 3 for positive. It's positive but maybe not extremely so since there aren't super strong adjectives like \"exhilarating\" or \"incredible.\"\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment of the text is positive due to words like \"gentle,\" \"comedy,\" and \"embrace,\" which convey a welcoming and pleasant tone.\n\n3", 3, 3, 32.0243422719941], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the words used. The word \"drama\" can have different connotations depending on context. In general, drama refers to a genre of plays or movies that focus on serious and often emotional themes. It doesn't inherently carry a positive or negative sentiment; it's more about the subject matter.\n\nThe phrase is just \"a drama?\" without any additional words. The question mark could indicate uncertainty or surprise. If someone says \"a drama?\", they might be questioning if something qualifies as a drama, which isn't necessarily expressing an emotion but rather seeking clarification or showing mild interest.\n\nSince there are no strong adjectives or emotional words like \"amazing\" or \"terrible,\" the sentiment doesn't lean towards positive or negative. It's more of a neutral statement. The question mark might add a slight nuance, perhaps implying curiosity without any clear positivity or negativity.\n\nConsidering all this, I don't see any indicators that would push the sentiment into being negative or positive. It seems to be a straightforward observation without emotional charge.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 2, 26.956440278008813], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break down the sentence.\n\nThe sentence is: \"a memorable experience that , like many of his works , presents weighty issues colorfully wrapped up in his own idiosyncratic strain of kitschy goodwill .\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at key words here. \"Memorable experience\" sounds positive because it's a good thing to remember. Then, it says \"presents weighty issues.\" Weighty can mean important or serious, which isn't inherently negative but might suggest complexity.\n\nNext, the phrase \"colorfully wrapped up\" suggests something vibrant and appealing. The word \"idiosyncratic\" means having unique traits, which could be neutral but often has a positive connotation when it's about art or creativity. \"Kitschy goodwill\" uses \"kitschy,\" which usually refers to something overly sentimental or tacky, but in this context, since it's paired with \"goodwill,\" it seems more positive than negative.\n\nPutting it all together: the experience is memorable (positive), presents serious issues in a colorful way (appealing and engaging), wrapped up uniquely with kitschy goodwill (a bit quirky but still good). The overall tone seems positive without being extremely so. So, I'd rate this as 3, which is positive.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 3, 31.191830071009463], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me read the text carefully: \"often messy and frustrating, but very pleasing at its best moments, it's very much like life itself.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the phrases. The beginning says \"often messy and frustrating,\" which clearly has negative connotations. Those words are pretty strong negatives\u2014messy implies disorder, frustration suggests annoyance or dissatisfaction.\n\nBut then there's a shift with \"but very pleasing at its best moments.\" Here, \"pleasing\" is positive, so that adds a positive aspect. The phrase \"at its best moments\" tempers the positivity a bit because it's not always positive, just occasionally. \n\nThe last part mentions \"it's very much like life itself.\" Life can have both ups and downs, so this could imply an overall balanced view but with more focus on the positives if considering that life has good moments despite challenges.\n\nPutting it all together: there are negative elements but also significant positive ones. The text doesn't lean heavily in one direction; instead, it presents a mix. However, since the user included both negatives and positives without any extreme words beyond \"very,\" I should consider whether the sentiment is more neutral or leans slightly positive.\n\nI think the presence of the positive descriptor (\"pleasing\") might tip it towards neutral with a slight positivity. But given that the first part is quite negative, maybe it's balanced but not strongly positive. Therefore, on the scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive), I'd rate this as 2 for neutral because while there are both elements, they balance each other out.\n</think>\n\nThe text has a mix of negative and positive sentiments.

The overall sentiment is balanced, leaning towards neutral.\n\n2", 2, 3, 39.51672714098822], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is: \"it 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the words to understand their meanings and connotations. Let's start with \"petty thievery.\" Petty usually means something small or trivial, so petty thievery might refer to minor thefts or stealing in a small way. But when combined with \"like this,\" it seems like the speaker is comparing the situation to such thievery, implying that something about what they're talking about (probably a movie) is being criticized as if it's committing a minor offense.\n\nNext part: \"puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars.\" Flimsy means lacking strength or quality; so a \"flimsy flick\" would be a weak, poorly made movie. \"Behind bars\" typically refers to jail, but here it seems metaphorical, suggesting that such movies should be confined or criticized harshly.\n\nPutting it together: The sentence is comparing the act of petty thievery (maybe referring to how the movie steals ideas or is unoriginal) and then saying that flimsy flicks like this are put behind bars. So, the speaker is criticizing a movie as being weak and perhaps deserving of punishment or harsh judgment.\n\nThe overall tone seems negative because words like \"petty,\" \"flimsy,\" and \"behind bars\" all have negative connotations. The speaker isn't just expressing dissatisfaction but is also using strong language to condemn the movie.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, etc. Since the sentiment is clearly negative with strong criticism, it's more than just a little negative (so not 1). The use of harsh metaphors like \"behind bars\" and describing flicks as flimsy suggests a stronger negative emotion.\n\nSo I think this should be classified as very negative, which is 0.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is very negative due to the strong criticism and harsh metaphors used. \n\nAnswer: 0", 0, 0, 48.46219830799964], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It's talking about mistakes a director made while filming an opera. The phrase \"every conceivable mistake\" suggests that all possible errors were made. That sounds pretty harsh. The word \"perpetrated\" is strong too; it usually has negative connotations, implying something wrong or harmful was done.\n\nPutting this together, the speaker is pointing out significant failures in the director's work. This seems very critical and disappointed. So, I'm thinking this isn't just a little negative but extremely so because they're saying every possible mistake was made. That would lean towards the most negative option available, which is 0.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed is strongly negative due to the mention of all possible mistakes being made and the use of a harsh term like \"perpetrated.\" \n\nAnswer: 0", 0, 0, 22.016011430998333], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase starts with \"so devoid,\" which means completely lacking something. Then it specifies \"pleasure or sensuality,\" both of which are positive experiences. So the text is saying that whatever is being described has no pleasure or sensuality.\n\nNext, it adds that it's \"not even be dubbed hedonistic.\" Hedonism refers to seeking and enjoying pleasure, so not being hedonistic means it's lacking in those areas. The overall tone seems negative because the absence of positive elements like pleasure is highlighted.\n\nI'm thinking about how strong this sentiment is. It's definitely negative, but is it very negative? Well, \"devoid\" is a strong word, indicating a complete lack. However, there's no explicit emotional language beyond that. So while it's negative, maybe not extremely so. \n\nConsidering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative. Since the sentiment is clearly negative but without extreme descriptors like anger or disaster, I'd lean towards 1. It's pointing out a lack of positive elements without strong emotional intensity.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a negative sentiment by highlighting the absence of pleasure and sensuality, making it difficult to classify as hedonistic. The use of \"devoid\" indicates a significant lack but doesn't convey extreme negativity.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 0, 29.891220583987888], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The first part says \"a brilliant gag,\" which sounds positive because \"brilliant\" is a strong positive adjective and \"gag\" usually refers to something funny or amusing. But then it continues with \"at the expense of those who paid for it and those who pay to see it.\" That part seems negative because it suggests that people are being made fun of or taken advantage of, which might be seen as mocking or disrespectful.\n\nSo, on one hand, there's a positive element with \"brilliant gag,\" but on the other, it's taking that at someone else's expense. I'm trying to determine if the overall sentiment is more negative or positive. The phrase \"at the expense of\" typically implies some kind of harm or disadvantage to others, so even though the first part is positive, the latter part adds a negative connotation.\n\nI think the balance here leans towards neutral because while there's praise for the gag being brilliant, it's tempered by the fact that it's at someone else's expense. It doesn't come across as overly harsh or extremely positive. The person might be acknowledging the humor but also pointing out that it comes with a cost to others.\n\nSo putting it all together, I'd say the sentiment is neutral, which corresponds to 2.\n</think>\n\nThe text combines praise for a \"brilliant gag\" with criticism of its impact on others, resulting in a neutral sentiment. \n\nAnswer: 2", 2, 2, 34.607756915997015], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me read the sentence again: \"count on his movie to work at the back of your neck long after you leave the theater.\" Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what this means. \n\nFirst, breaking down the words. \"Count on\" usually means relying on something, so maybe it's saying that the movie is reliable or has an impact. The phrase \"to work at the back of your neck\" is a bit confusing. It might be metaphorical, perhaps meaning that the movie leaves a lasting impression or makes you think about it long after watching.\n\nSo putting it together, it sounds like the speaker is saying that his movie will have an effect on you even after you've left the theater. That could imply that the movie was impactful or memorable in a good way. \n\nNow, considering sentiment scores: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. The sentence doesn't use strong positive words like \"excellent\" or \"wonderful,\" but it does suggest a lasting impression, which is generally a good thing in the context of movies. \n\nI think this leans towards a positive sentiment. It's not extremely positive, so maybe a 3 instead of a 4 because there aren't superlatives used here. The phrase \"count on\" also gives me confidence that it's reliable or effective, which adds to the positivity.\n</think>\n\nThe text suggests that the movie leaves a lasting impression, indicating a positive sentiment without using strong adjectives.\n\n3", 3, 2, 33.41392711899243], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user provided a sentence about a documentary and wants me to classify its sentiment on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive.\n\nFirst, let's break down the given text: \"a sharp and quick documentary that is funny and pithy , while illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that , while past , really isn't.\"\n\nStarting with the first part: \"sharp and quick\" \u2013 those are positive adjectives. Sharp usually means clever or insightful, and quick suggests it's concise or fast-paced. So that's a good start.\n\nNext, it says \"funny and pithy.\" Funny is definitely positive; humor often indicates enjoyment. Pithy means concise and impactful, which is another compliment. So this part adds to the positive sentiment.\n\nThen, the sentence continues: \"while illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that, while past, really isn't.\" The phrase \"illuminating\" suggests that it provides clear or enlightening information about a past era, but then it says \"really isn't,\" which is a bit confusing. It seems like maybe the era isn't truly past because its influence continues? Or perhaps there's some ambiguity here.\n\nPutting it all together: the documentary is described with several positive adjectives \u2013 sharp, quick, funny, pithy, illuminating. The only potential negative or neutral part is the ending about the era being past but \"really isn't,\" which might be pointing out that even though the era has passed, its impact remains relevant. That could still be a positive point because it adds depth to the documentary's content.\n\nConsidering all these positive descriptors and the overall tone, I think the sentiment leans more towards positive. It doesn't use extremely strong words like \"excellent\" or \"amazing,\" but it's definitely favorable. So on the scale of 0 to 4, this would be a 3 \u2013 positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses several positive adjectives such as \"sharp,\" \"quick,\" \"funny,\" and \"pithy.\" It also mentions that the documentary illuminates an era of comedy in a way that shows it's still relevant.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the words used: \"bland\" is definitely not a positive word. It means something lacks flavor or interest, which is generally considered a downside. The phrase \"rather bland\" adds emphasis, making it clear that the speaker finds it notably lacking in excitement or quality.\n\nNow, considering the overall sentiment. Since \"bland\" is negative but not extremely so, and it's used in a descriptive context rather than with strong emotion, I think it falls into a moderate negative category. It's not as harsh as words like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" which might warrant a 0. Instead, it's more of a mild criticism.\n\nAlso, the structure of the sentence is somewhat neutral because it doesn't include any intensifiers beyond \"rather.\" There's no exclamation mark or other punctuation to suggest stronger emotion. It's a straightforward statement about something being uninteresting.\n\nSo putting this together, the sentiment isn't extremely negative but does express dissatisfaction. On the scale provided, that would be 1 for negative rather than 0, which is reserved for very strong negatives.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses mild dissatisfaction with the term \"bland,\" indicating a negative sentiment but not an extreme one.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 31.437157751002815], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The output should be an integer from 0 to 4, with 0 being very negative and 4 very positive.\n\nThe text given is: \"if the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is -lrb- cattaneo -rrb- sophomore slump .\"\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what this sentence means. It seems like it's comparing two things related to someone named Cattaneo. The first part mentions \"The Full Monty\" as a freshman fluke. A \"fluke\" usually refers to something that happens by chance or luck, not necessarily good or bad on its own, but often implying something unexpected.\n\nThen it says \"lucky break is... sophomore slump.\" Now, a lucky break is generally a positive thing\u2014it's an unexpected stroke of good fortune. However, the term \"sophomore slump\" usually refers to a decline in performance during one's second year (sophomore year), which can be negative because it implies underperformance or failure.\n\nPutting it together: The sentence suggests that while \"The Full Monty\" might have been just a lucky first-year event, this new thing (\"lucky break\") is a sophomore slump. So the overall sentiment here seems to be pointing out a decline from what was initially perhaps a positive but now turned negative.\n\nI also notice that there are some punctuation marks and parentheses which don't affect the sentiment directly, but they do structure the sentence as a comparison between two concepts: freshman fluke vs. sophomore slump.\n\nThe words \"lucky break\" might seem positive on their own, but in this context, it's being used to highlight the contrast with \"sophomore slump,\" which is definitely negative. So the overall sentiment leans towards negative because it's pointing out a downfall or failure after an initial success.\n\nI don't see any overtly positive language here; the focus is more on the negative outcome of the sophomore year compared to the freshman year, even if that freshman success was just a fluke.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 1, 44.34880727302516], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase \"thematic meat\" implies depth or meaningful themes, so that's a plus.\n\nHowever, the sentence then contrasts that with the overall assessment by saying it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance. This seems critical because it's pointing out that while there might be some thematic content, the focus is more on style rather than developing characters or having substantial depth. The word \"emphasizes\" here could have a negative connotation if it suggests neglecting important aspects.\n\nPutting this together, the sentiment isn't extremely positive since there are criticisms about character development and substance being overshadowed by style. But it's also not entirely negative because the first part acknowledges some thematic strength. So, the overall tone is somewhat neutral but leans slightly towards negative due to the emphasis on style over other elements which might be seen as shortcomings.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this sentiment as 2 (neutral) because while there are both positive and negative points mentioned, they balance out without leaning heavily in either direction.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence acknowledges some thematic depth but criticizes the movie for prioritizing style over substance.

First, the word \"flimsier\" stands out. That's a negative term, implying something is weak or not substantial. Then there are adjectives like \"out-sized,\" which could be neutral depending on context, but in this case seems to suggest things are exaggerated in a bad way. \"Out of character\" probably means inconsistent with what's expected, which isn't good if it's unexpected in a negative way.\n\nThe phrase \"logically porous\" catches my attention too. Porous usually refers to something that allows passage through pores, but here it likely means the logic has holes or is weak. So putting it all together: the text is criticizing something for being weak, inconsistent, and lacking solid logic in its action scenes. \n\nSo this seems like a negative sentiment. The use of multiple negative descriptors points towards a strong negative feeling. But how strong? It's not just one negative word; it's several pointing out flaws. So maybe it's more than just slightly negative.\n\nThe scale is 0 to 4, with 0 being very negative and 4 very positive. Since the sentiment is clearly negative but uses several strong terms, I think it falls into a higher level of negativity. It might be either 0 or 1. But \"decidedly flimsier\" suggests a significant weakness, so perhaps more than just slightly negative.\n\nWait, maybe not. Sometimes even with multiple negatives, the intensity isn't extremely high. The word \"flimsy\" is strong, but combined with other terms like \"out-sized\" and \"logically porous,\" it's definitely negative but not overly extreme in its wording. So I think 1 (negative) would be appropriate because while it's clearly negative, it's not the most extreme language possible.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to the use of terms like \"flimsier,\" \"out-sized,\" \"out of character,\" and \"logically porous,\" which critique the action scenes as weak and inconsistent. \n\n1", 1, 0, 47.355235568014905], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The speaker is talking about \"never growing old\" and mentions that there are a few advantages to this situation. So, they're acknowledging some benefits of not aging.\n\nThe phrase \"has to be a few advantages\" suggests that while there might not be many, there are still positive aspects. This indicates a slightly positive sentiment because the speaker is focusing on the good side. However, the use of \"a few\" implies that these advantages aren't numerous or overwhelming, so it's not extremely positive.\n\nI should also consider any negative connotations. The sentence doesn't express any direct negatives about aging; instead, it's more about the potential benefits of not doing so. So there's no indication of negativity here.\n\nPutting this together, the sentiment leans towards positive because they're highlighting advantages, but it's not overly enthusiastic since only a few are mentioned. Therefore, I think it falls under 3 (positive) rather than 4 (very positive), which would require stronger or more explicit positive language.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence acknowledges some positive aspects of never aging, though modestly. It leans positive without being strong.\n\n3", 3, 2, 30.250379219010938], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It's talking about a modern remake of Dumas' story. So, they're comparing it to the original, maybe? Or just evaluating the remake itself.\n\nThe phrase \"long on narrative\" suggests that there's a lot of focus on storytelling or plot development. That could be positive because detailed narratives can engage viewers. But then it says \"-lrb- too -rrb- short on action.\" The part in parentheses is probably \"too,\" so it reads as being too short on action. So, the remake has a lot of narrative but not enough action.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment: too much narrative might be seen as a negative if the audience expected more action or found the pacing slow. Similarly, too little action could disappoint those who enjoy that aspect. However, it's not an outright condemnation; it's more of a criticism pointing out a specific shortcoming.\n\nSo, is this negative? It seems like a critique but not overly harsh.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the sentence structure. It starts with \"It never plays as dramatic...\" which immediately catches my attention because \"never\" is a strong negative word. Then it says \"...even when dramatic things happen to people.\" So the speaker is pointing out that despite there being dramatic events, the portrayal or experience isn't as intense as expected.\n\nNow, considering sentiment analysis, words like \"never\" and phrases indicating unmet expectations can lean towards negative feelings. The phrase suggests disappointment because something was anticipated but not delivered. However, it's a bit more nuanced than just negative; the focus is on the lack of drama rather than any explicit negativity or positivity.\n\nI should also think about context. Without knowing what \"it\" refers to\u2014maybe a movie, a book, a situation\u2014it's hard to gauge if this is a criticism or not. But generally, pointing out that something isn't as dramatic as it could be might come off as slightly negative because the expectation wasn't met.\n\nOn the scale from 0 to 4, very negative would be 0, negative is 1, neutral is 2, positive is 3, and very positive is 4. Given that there's a slight disappointment but no strong emotion, it seems more like a neutral or slightly negative sentiment. However, since \"never\" is quite strong, maybe leaning towards negative.\n\nBut wait, the sentence doesn't express anger or sadness; it's more of an observation. So perhaps it's not as negative as 1. Maybe it's neutral because the sentiment isn't strongly positive or negative but just a statement about something not being as expected.\n\nWait again\u2014the use of \"never\" and the implication that dramatic events don't get the drama they deserve could indicate dissatisfaction, which would be more on the negative side. So maybe it's 1, negative, rather than neutral. But I'm not entirely sure because it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, considering the absence of strong positive or negative language beyond \"never,\" perhaps it's closer to neutral. The sentiment isn't overly enthusiastic, nor is it filled with anger or sadness. It's more of a critique in tone but not strongly negative.\n\nHmm, maybe I should err on the side of caution and go with 1 (negative) because of the use of \"never\" indicating that something consistently doesn't meet expectations, which can be seen as a criticism.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed is slightly negative due to the use of \"never,\" indicating unmet expectations.

They're saying that a fine documentary makes its subject interesting even to people not in the target audience. That sounds positive because they're highlighting a quality that makes the documentary stand out.\n\nI should consider if there are any negative words or implications here. The word \"mediocre\" is used, but it's comparing a good one to a mediocre one, so that's more about contrast rather than negativity towards documentaries in general. The overall message seems appreciative of what makes a documentary better.\n\nThe sentiment isn't extremely positive because it's not using superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"fantastic,\" just pointing out an effective quality. So maybe it's a 3, which is positive but not the highest level. Alternatively, if I think about it being neutral because it's more of an observation rather than expressing strong emotion, maybe a 2.

The sentence starts with \"I'll put it this way,\" which suggests that the speaker is about to explain or clarify something.\n\nNext, they mention a \"melodrama narrated by talking fish.\" Melodramas are typically dramatic stories often focused on emotions and conflicts, sometimes considered over-the-top or sensational. However, in this context, the use of \"talking fish\" adds an unusual twist. It could be seen as either intriguing or absurd, depending on the perspective.\n\nThe phrase \"this is the movie for you\" at the end suggests that the speaker is recommending it to someone who specifically enjoys such unique combinations\u2014melodrama and talking fish narrator. This recommendation implies that while the movie might not appeal to everyone, there's a specific audience who would appreciate it.\n\nNow, considering sentiment classification: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. The sentence doesn't express strong negative emotions like anger or dissatisfaction; instead, it seems more descriptive with a slight recommendation. It's not overly enthusiastic either, just pointing out that if someone likes this particular style, they might enjoy the movie.\n\nSo, is this sentiment neutral or slightly positive? Since the speaker isn't outright praising the movie but rather directing it towards a specific audience, it leans more towards neutral than positive. There's no negative language used, so it's not falling into the negative categories either.\n\nTherefore, I think the most appropriate classification here is 2 for neutral.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is neutral as it neither strongly praises nor criticizes the movie but rather directs it to a specific audience.\n\n2", 2, 2, 38.57450685900403], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Then, there's \"complete with receding hairline, weathered countenance\"\u2014these could be seen as negative descriptors if implying aging or looking tired, but in a performance context, they might just be part of the character.\n\nThe next part is about Breckin Meyer's voice being \"ridiculously inappropriate valley boy voice.\" The word \"ridiculously\" and \"inappropriate\" are strong negatives. It suggests that the voice didn't fit well, which could mean the sentiment here is negative.\n\nPutting it all together, while some parts are neutral or descriptive, the mention of an inappropriate and ridiculous voice stands out as a clear negative point.

The user wants me to classify it on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive. Let's break down the text step by step.\n\nThe text is: \"overall , it 's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine , acerbic laughs .\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for keywords that indicate sentiment. The word \"wacky\" suggests something unusual or crazy, which can be positive in a fun way. \"Inspired\" definitely has a positive connotation\u2014it means the film was creative and had good ideas.\n\nNext, \"little film\" might seem neutral, but in this context, it's probably not negative. It could imply that the film is charming despite its small scale. Then, \"works effortlessly\" shows that the film achieves its effect without much effort, which is a positive trait.\n\nNow, looking at \"genuine, acerbic laughs.\" \"Genuine\" means real and heartfelt, so that's positive. \"Acerbic\" usually refers to sharp or biting humor, but in this context, it seems like it's being used positively because the film delivers these kinds of laughs well. So overall, both words contribute to a positive sentiment.\n\nPutting it all together: The text uses several positive adjectives and phrases like \"wacky,\" \"inspired,\" \"works effortlessly,\" \"genuine,\" and \"acerbic laughs.\" There are no negative words here. The structure is also affirmative, stating that the film successfully delivers these qualities without any criticism.\n\nI should consider if there's any neutrality. The word \"overall\" sets a general tone but doesn't add negativity or positivity on its own. However, since all other descriptors are positive, it leans more towards a positive sentiment rather than neutral.\n\nOn the scale, 4 is very positive. But does this text reach that level? Let me think. While it's definitely positive, \"wacky\" and \"inspired\" suggest creativity without necessarily being extremely effusive praise. The film delivers laughs effortlessly, but maybe not in an overwhelmingly positive way. So perhaps it's a solid positive but not the highest possible.\n\nWait, but considering all the positive adjectives together, maybe 4 is appropriate because each descriptor adds up to a very favorable opinion. \"Wacky and inspired\" indicates originality and creativity, while \"genuine acerbic laughs\" mean the humor is both real and sharp, which are strong positives.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit torn between 3 and 4. But given that all aspects mentioned are positive without any reservations, it seems like the sentiment is very positive. So I'll go with 4.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses several positive adjectives such as \"wacky,\" \"inspired,\" and describes the film's ability to deliver genuine and acerbic laughs effortlessly.

Let me start by reading the sentence carefully: \"Given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece, the picture begins to resemble the shapeless, grasping actors' workshop that it is.\"\n\nHmm, let's break this down word by word. The phrase \"too much time\" suggests that there was a lot of consideration given, which might imply overthinking or perhaps dissatisfaction with the outcome. Then, \"the looseness of the piece\"\u2014that could mean the structure isn't tight, maybe it's too vague or lacks direction.\n\nThe sentence continues: \"the picture begins to resemble the shapeless, grasping actors' workshop that it is.\" So here, they're comparing the picture (maybe a film or artwork) to an actors' workshop. An actors' workshop can be a place where people experiment and maybe things aren't polished yet\u2014it's more about exploration than a finished product.\n\nThe words \"shapeless\" and \"grasping\" are strong negative terms. Shapeless implies a lack of form or structure, which isn't usually a compliment in creative works. Grasping suggests desperation or not quite achieving the desired effect, so that's another negative point.\n\nPutting it all together: The text seems critical of the piece, pointing out its looseness and comparing it unfavorably to an actors' workshop, which might be seen as messy or unpolished. So overall, the sentiment is negative. Now, how negative? \n\nThe words used are pretty strong\u2014shapeless and grasping carry significant weight.

So, saying it feels \"too much\" implies that it went overboard.\n\nNext, comparing the film to an infomercial is significant. Infomericals are usually considered sales pitches and not high-quality content. This comparison might be implying that the film was more about promoting a book than being a genuine cinematic experience, which could be seen as negative.\n\nAlso, the target demographic mentioned is \"boomers,\" which refers to baby boomers. While this isn't inherently negative, combining it with the infomercial comparison suggests that the film might have been pandering or overly focused on selling to that group rather than offering a broader appeal.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment seems critical of the film for being more promotional than engaging. Therefore, I would rate this as a 1 (negative) because while it's not extremely harsh, there's clear criticism about the film's approach.\n</think>\n\nThe text criticizes the film for feeling like an infomercial, which is negative but not extremely so.\n\n1", 1, 1, 31.010765343991807], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Then \"thriller\" indicates an action-packed genre, often well-received by audiences. The phrase \"delivers a surprising punch\" implies that it has a strong impact or twist, which is typically seen as a compliment in reviews.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment seems positive.

Let me read the text again: \"the predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the words used. The phrase starts with \"predominantly amateur cast,\" which might not be inherently negative, but it's followed by describing them as \"painful to watch.\" That word, \"painful,\" is a strong negative indicator. It suggests that watching them was an unpleasant experience.\n\nNext, the text mentions that their performances are \"stilted and unconvincing.\" Both of these adjectives have negative connotations. \"Stilted\" implies that the acting feels unnatural or forced, while \"unconvincing\" means it's not believable. These words clearly express dissatisfaction with the actors' performances.\n\nI should consider how strong these negatives are. The use of \"painful\" is quite intense; it goes beyond just saying something isn't good to expressing discomfort or distress at watching it. This suggests a strong negative sentiment rather than a mild one.\n\nLooking at the scale, 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, up to 4 being very positive. Given that the text uses strong negative language and doesn't balance it with any positives, it's leaning towards the lower end of the scale. It's not just a minor criticism but something that affects the overall experience negatively.\n\nI should also think about the context. The statement is about an amateur cast, which might be expected to have less polished performances, but the use of \"painful\" and terms like \"stilted\" indicates that the quality was particularly poor, beyond what one might expect from amateurs. This reinforces the negative sentiment.\n\nSo putting it all together: strong negative adjectives, no positive elements, and a focus on how uncomfortable or unpleasant the experience was.

The phrase starts with \"perfectly pleasant,\" which immediately gives a positive impression. \"Pleasant\" is clearly a positive word, so that's good. Then there's \"if slightly pokey.\" Now, \"pokey\" here might mean slow or dragging, right? So that could be a negative point because it suggests the comedy isn't as fast-paced or engaging as one might expect.\n\nSo now I have two sentiments: positive and somewhat negative. The sentence structure uses \"if\" which often introduces a condition or contrast. In this case, it's balancing a positive adjective (\"pleasant\") with a slightly negative one (\"pokey\"). \n\nI should consider how strong each of these adjectives is. \"Perfectly pleasant\" sounds quite positive\u2014maybe even stronger than just \"nice.\" On the flip side, \"slightly pokey\" doesn't seem as harsh. It's more of a mild criticism rather than a severe negative.\n\nPutting it together, the overall sentiment seems to be leaning towards positive but with some reservations.

The main words here are \"quiet,\" \"disquieting,\" and \"triumph.\" \n\n\"Quiet\" is neutral; it just describes something without much noise or activity. Then there's \"disquieting,\" which means causing anxiety or unease. That's definitely a negative word because it implies discomfort or worry.\n\nNow, the key word here is \"triumph.\" Triumph generally has a positive connotation\u2014it refers to a great victory or success. But it's modified by \"disquieting,\" so that adds a twist. It\u2019s not just any triumph; it's one that causes unease.\n\nPutting it together: The sentence talks about a quiet, uneasy victory. So the sentiment isn't entirely positive because of the disquieting aspect. It's more like a bittersweet success\u2014positive but with underlying concerns or discomfort.\n\nI need to decide on the scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive. Since there are both positive and negative elements, it might lean towards neutral. However, \"triumph\" still carries a positive weight even if it's unsettling.\n\nConsidering that, I think it's more on the positive side but not extremely so because of the disquieting factor. So maybe a 2 or 3. But since it's a triumph with some negativity, perhaps 2 is better\u2014neutral with a slight lean towards negative due to \"disquieting.\" Alternatively, if the triumph outweighs the unease, it might be 3.\n\nWait, but the user said to classify based on how negative or positive it is. The presence of both elements makes it tricky. Maybe the negative aspect is stronger because \"disquieting\" adds a significant emotional weight. So maybe 2 (neutral) isn't quite right. It could be between neutral and slightly negative.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think again: Triumph is positive, disquieting is negative. The sentence structure emphasizes both aspects equally? Or does it present the triumph despite the unease?\n\nI think the sentiment leans more towards positive because it's a triumph, but with some reservations due to \"disquieting.\" So perhaps 3 (positive) is appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment of the text combines elements of triumph (positive) and disquieting (negative), resulting in an overall positive leaning despite the unease.

Let me start by reading the text carefully.\n\nThe sentence says: \"at a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had , godfrey reggio 's career shines like a lonely beacon.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break this down into parts. The first part talks about commercialism squeezing the life out of idealism in American moviemaking. That sounds pretty negative because it implies that the focus on making money has ruined any good intentions or creativity (idealism) in the movie industry.\n\nThen, the second part mentions Godfrey Reggio's career shining like a lonely beacon. A beacon is usually a positive thing, something guiding or showing light in darkness. So this part seems positive because it praises his work as standing out and providing hope or direction amidst the negative situation described earlier.\n\nNow, I need to weigh these two parts. The first part is definitely negative, highlighting a problem with commercialism. But the second part is positive about Godfrey Reggio's career. It might be seen as a counterpoint to the negativity in the industry, showing that despite the issues, there are still positives like his work.\n\nI should consider if the overall sentiment leans more towards positive or negative. The first part sets up a bleak picture, but then it contrasts with something positive about Reggio's career. However, the structure of the sentence starts with the negative aspect and ends on a positive note, which might make the overall sentiment somewhat balanced but leaning slightly positive because it's highlighting someone who stands out positively.\n\nBut wait, I also need to think about how strong each part is. The commercialism squeezing idealism sounds pretty harsh, using words like \"squeezed the life out\" and \"whatever idealism.\" That's a strong negative statement. However, the positive part describes his career as shining, which suggests it's making an impact or being effective despite the challenges.\n\nSo overall, the sentence is pointing out both negatives and positives. The first part is quite negative about the state of moviemaking, but the second part is positive about Reggio's work. Since the question asks for a single score from 0 to 4, I need to decide if it's neutral because it has both elements or slightly positive because it ends on a note that highlights a positive beacon.\n\nI think the mention of the beacon might give it an overall positive slant, even though the beginning is negative. So maybe it's not extremely positive (which would be 4) but somewhere in the middle to high side. But since the first part is quite strong in negativity and the second part is a counterbalance, perhaps the sentiment isn't fully neutral either.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider if the positive aspect is strong enough to tip the balance towards a 3 (positive). Alternatively, because it's pointing out both sides but starting with a negative, it might be neutral. However, since the beacon implies something positive that stands out, perhaps it's more than neutral. \n\nI think I'll go with 2 for neutral because it presents both negative and positive elements without leaning too heavily in either direction. But wait, the structure of the sentence ends on the positive note, so maybe it's slightly positive. Alternatively, considering the strength of the negative description, it might still be a bit more balanced.\n\nWait, another thought: if the first part is very negative (like 0) and the second part is positive (4), how does that average out? If both are equally presented, perhaps the sentiment is neutral. But the sentence starts with the problem and ends with the solution or positive example, which might make it lean towards positive.\n\nI'm a bit torn between neutral (2) and positive (3). Given that the positive aspect is highlighted as a beacon amidst the negativity, I think it's slightly more positive than negative. So maybe 3.\n</think>\n\nThe text contrasts the negative impact of commercialism on American moviemaking with the positive example of Godfrey Reggio's career. While the first part is strongly negative, the second part highlights positivity. The sentence ends on a hopeful note, suggesting an overall positive sentiment.\n\nAnswer: 3", 3, 3, 82.62993232198642], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The words used here are \"odd,\" \"distant,\" which aren't necessarily negative but might imply something unusual or not very engaging. Then it mentions that the movie \"borrows from\" other films, which could suggest it's derivative rather than original.\n\nThe phrase \"art-house gay porn film\" is interesting. Art-house usually has a more serious or avant-garde connotation, while \"gay porn\" can be seen as explicit or adult content. So putting them together might imply that the film is trying to blend these elements, but I'm not sure if this is positive or negative.\n\nThe overall tone seems neutral with a slight lean towards negative because words like \"odd,\" \"distant,\" and \"more or less borrows\" don't sound overly positive. However, there's no strong negative language either. So maybe it's somewhere in the middle.\n\nI think the sentiment is neutral but leaning slightly negative because of the words used to describe it as odd and borrowing from others, which could imply it doesn't stand out positively. But I'm not entirely sure if that's a negative or just descriptive.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 1, 31.682670768001117], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text in question is: \"during the tuxedo's 90 minutes of screen time, there isn't one true 'chan moment'.\" Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each number represents. 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. My job is to figure out where the sentiment of that sentence falls.\n\nLooking at the text, it mentions \"the tuxedo's 90 minutes\" which I think refers to a movie or show. The key part here is \"there isn't one true 'chan moment'.\" Now, I'm not entirely sure what a 'chan moment' refers to. Maybe it's a specific type of scene or event that fans expect? Perhaps something dramatic or emotional?\n\nSo the statement is pointing out that throughout the entire runtime (90 minutes), there wasn't a single instance of this expected moment. That sounds like a criticism because it's implying the movie didn't deliver on what was anticipated.\n\nThe user wants to know if this sentiment is negative, positive, etc. Since the text is pointing out an absence of something that should have been there, it likely has a negative connotation. But how strong is that negativity?\n\nThe phrase \"there isn't one\" suggests disappointment but maybe not extremely so. It's more of a letdown than a complete disaster. So I wouldn't rate this as very negative (0). Instead, it's probably a 1 for negative because the sentiment is clearly unfavorable but not overly harsh.\n\nI should consider if there are any other interpretations. Maybe 'chan moment' isn't negative? But without context, it's safer to assume that expecting such a moment and not getting it leads to dissatisfaction.

So, my goal is to determine where this sentence falls.\n\nLooking at the sentence, it's comparing Cho to other comics. It mentions that her confidence in her material is merited. The word \"merited\" suggests that her confidence is justified or well-deserved. That sounds positive because it implies she has good reasons to be confident, which reflects positively on her work and personality.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. Words like \"difference\" are neutral but then followed by a positive assessment of her confidence being merited. So the overall sentiment seems positive.\n\nSince there's no extreme language, just a straightforward compliment about her justified confidence, it doesn't seem to reach the very positive level (4).

The user starts by saying it's \"less a movie than...an appalling, odoriferous thing.\" Appalling means extremely bad or unpleasant, which is negative. Odoriferous refers to having a strong smell, usually unpleasant, so that's also negative.\n\nThen, they describe it as \"so rotten in almost every single facet of production.\" Rotten is clearly negative and implies something is very bad or decaying. They emphasize this by saying \"almost every single facet,\" meaning multiple aspects are bad.\n\nFinally, the text says you'll want to crawl up your own... (with asterisks for profanity). This expression is used when something is so bad that it causes extreme embarrassment or disgust. So the sentiment here is extremely negative.\n\nPutting it all together, the words used are strongly negative: appalling, odoriferous, rotten, and the profane expression indicating deep embarrassment. There's no neutral or positive language in this text. The intensity of these words suggests a very strong negative sentiment.\n\nSo I should assign the lowest score which is 0 for very negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses strongly negative terms like \"appalling,\" \"odoriferous,\" and \"rotten\" to describe something as extremely bad, leading to a classification of 0 (very negative).\n\n0", 0, 0, 36.56220540398499], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The main subject here seems to be referring to something that \"doesn't really know or care about the characters.\" This part suggests a lack of concern or interest towards the characters involved. Using them as \"markers for a series of preordained events\" implies that their roles are predictable and possibly unoriginal.\n\nPutting this together, the sentiment expressed is negative because it's criticizing how the subject treats the characters without depth or originality. The words \"doesn't really know,\" \"care,\" and \"preordained\" all contribute to a negative connotation.\n\nI think the appropriate classification here would be 1 (negative), as the text clearly expresses dissatisfaction but isn't extremely harsh.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed is negative, indicating dissatisfaction with how characters are treated. \n\n1", 1, 1, 23.207584265008336], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It implies it's not good enough and maybe even deceptive in its attempt.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment is clearly negative. Now, how strong is this negativity? The use of strong adjectives like \"virulently unpleasant\" indicates a high level of dissatisfaction. So I think 1 (negative) would be appropriate because it's not just a little negative but quite harsh. There's no neutral or positive language here.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is strongly negative due to words like \"banal,\" \"virulently unpleasant,\" and the critical tone regarding the romantic comedy.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 0, 26.982321008021245], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It says, \"You don't want to call the cops.\" So, the person is advising against calling the police. Why would someone not want to call the cops? Maybe they're in a situation where involving law enforcement isn't desired\u2014perhaps because of past negative experiences, fear of repercussions, or maybe something else.\n\nI think about the sentiment here. The phrase \"don't want\" suggests reluctance or hesitation. It's not outright negative like a complaint or accusation but shows some level of aversion. So, it's more on the negative side than positive, but not extremely so.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. Since there's no strong emotion here\u2014like anger or excitement\u2014it doesn't reach a very negative level (which would be 0). It also isn't completely neutral because it does express a desire not to take an action that might otherwise be considered positive, like seeking help.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards either 1 or 2. The sentence is advising against something, which carries a slightly negative connotation but isn't overly harsh. Therefore, I think the sentiment is just slightly negative, so it should be a 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text \"you don't want to call the cops\" is slightly negative because it shows reluctance without strong emotion.\n\n1", 1, 2, 35.82730455501587], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase \"doesn't even seem like she tried\" suggests that the person didn't make any effort, which could imply disappointment or frustration. \n\nI should consider the intensity of this sentiment. It's not just saying she didn't try; it's adding emphasis with \"even,\" which might make it a bit stronger. But is it extremely negative?

The title in quotes is \"'Me Without You',\" which sounds like it could be a book or movie title. Then the main part says it's a \"probing examination\" \u2013 that means they're looking deeply into something, so maybe it's serious and thoughtful. \n\nNext, it's about a \"female friendship.\" Friendships can have both positive and negative aspects depending on context, but in this case, since it's an examination, it might be neutral or leaning towards positive if it's highlighting strong bonds.\n\nThen the phrase \"set against a few dynamic decades\" suggests that the story spans over several changing years. The word \"dynamic\" usually has a positive connotation, implying change and movement, which can add depth to the narrative.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence seems informative without any explicitly negative or overly positive language. Words like \"probing\" and \"dynamic\" aren't strong enough in either direction; they just describe the nature of the examination and the time span. There's no indication of emotional extremes here, so it doesn't seem very positive or very negative.\n\nI don't see any strongly positive words like \"wonderful,\" \"amazing,\" or \"fabulous.\" Similarly, there aren't negative terms like \"terrible,\" \"awful,\" or \"disappointing.\" It's more about presenting the subject matter without a clear emotional tone.

Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the word \"heartbreakingly\" stands out to me. That usually has a negative connotation because it relates to sadness or emotional pain. But then there's \"beautiful,\" which is definitely positive. So that part is mixing a negative and positive emotion.\n\nNext, the phrase \"exquisitely sad.\" \"Exquisitely\" adds intensity, so it's not just a little bit sad but really deeply so. That makes me think of something that's both profound in its sadness and maybe also has some beauty to it, like a tragic story or a moving piece of art.\n\nPutting them together, the text seems to capture a bittersweet feeling. It's both emotionally painful and aesthetically pleasing at the same time. So there's a mix here\u2014sadness but with an appreciation for the beauty in that sadness.\n\nNow, thinking about sentiment scores: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The text isn't purely negative because of \"beautiful,\" nor is it purely positive because of \"heartbreakingly\" and \"sad.\" It's a blend. So where does that fall? \n\nI think the overall sentiment leans towards negative but with some positive elements. Since it's about sadness and heartbreak, which are strong emotions, maybe it skews more negative. But because there's also beauty involved, perhaps it doesn't go all the way to 0 or 1. Maybe a 2 for neutral isn't quite right either.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that even though there's sadness, the use of \"beautiful\" and \"exquisitely\" might make the sentiment lean slightly more towards positive than negative. But no, heartbreak is definitely a strong negative emotion. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's balanced enough to be neutral. However, given that both aspects are present but maybe the overall feeling is more on the sadder side with some beauty. So I'm torn between 1 and 2.\n\nBut considering the words used\u2014\"heartbreakingly\" and \"exquisitely sad\"\u2014they emphasize the depth of sadness. The \"beautiful\" part might be a mitigating factor, making it not as negative as 0 or 1 but still more on the negative side than neutral. So maybe it's a 2 because the positive aspect is present but doesn't overpower the sadness.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes in sentiment analysis, words like \"exquisite\" can sometimes be used positively even when describing something sad. Like \"exquisitely crafted\" or \"exquisite detail.\" But here it's paired with \"sad,\" so it's enhancing the negative aspect. \n\nSo perhaps the overall sentiment is negative but not extremely so. So a 1? Or maybe a 2 because of the mix.\n\nAlternatively, since both positive and negative are present, and they balance each other out, it might be neutral at 2. But I'm leaning towards 2 because while there's sadness, the beauty aspect softens it.

The phrase starts with \"In truth,\" which suggests that what follows is an honest assessment. Then it says, \"it has all the heart of a porno flick.\" Here, \"heart\" might refer to the core or essence, so the speaker is comparing whatever they're talking about (maybe a movie, book, or another work) to a pornographic film in terms of its emotional core.\n\nNext part: \"but none of the sheer lust.\" This seems to be a contrast. So while it has the heart of a porno flick, it lacks the intense sexual desire that one might expect from such content. \n\nPutting it together, the sentiment here isn't straightforwardly positive or negative. The comparison to a porno flick could have a negative connotation because it's often associated with being shallow or lacking depth. However, the use of \"heart\" suggests that maybe there is some emotional substance, but without the intense passion (\"sheer lust\") that one might expect.\n\nI'm trying to gauge whether this is more positive or negative. The mention of having the heart of a porno flick could imply that it's not very deep or meaningful, which leans towards negative. On the other hand, perhaps the speaker is saying it has emotional depth without being explicit or overly sexual, which might be seen as a positive trait if they're avoiding the stereotypical elements.\n\nBut overall, I think the comparison to a porno flick is meant to point out that while there's an attempt at emotion (heart), it falls short in delivering the expected intensity. This could come off as somewhat critical, hence negative. However, since it's not overly harsh and more of a neutral observation with a slight critique, maybe it's just slightly negative.\n\nWait, but the user wants only one integer from 0 to 4.

There's no positive language here; everything points towards a lack of success or appeal.\n\nSo, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, which this might be close to because of the strong negative words. But since it's not using extremely harsh terms like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" maybe it's just negative enough for a score of 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to the use of words like \"inexpressible,\" \"drab,\" and \"wannabe.\" These terms convey a sense of failure or lackluster effort.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 31.16085949301487], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is: \"all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper 's approach to the material is too upbeat .\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. It starts by saying that all elements are there for a great film noir. That sounds positive because it mentions \"great\" and implies that the foundation is solid.\n\nBut then, there's a \"but,\" which often signals a contrast or a negative point. The second part says the director's approach is too upbeat. Film noir typically has a darker, more serious tone, so an upbeat approach might not fit well with the genre expectations. This could be seen as a criticism because it suggests that the director didn't stick to the genre's conventions.\n\nSo, putting it together: The first part is positive, and the second part is negative but not extremely so. The sentiment isn't overly negative because it starts on a good note but then points out a flaw in execution. I think this leans towards being negative but not very negative.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment is likely 1 (negative).\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a mix of positive and negative sentiments but ultimately leans negative due to the criticism of the director's approach. \n\nOutput: 1", 1, 1, 30.103433762997156], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the phrase starts with \"little more than,\" which often has a slightly negative connotation. It suggests that something is barely better than what's described next. Then it says \"a super-sized infomercial.\" An infomercial is typically an advertisement, so describing it as super-sized might imply it's overly promotional or maybe a bit excessive.\n\nThe text mentions the cable-sports channel and its summer X games. So, it's talking about a specific event or program. Now, the way it's phrased makes me think that the speaker isn't impressed with the content, viewing it more as an advertisement rather than something substantial or entertaining on its own merits.\n\nI'm trying to gauge the sentiment here. Words like \"little more than\" and \"infomercial\" have negative implications because they suggest that whatever is being discussed isn't much beyond a promotion. It doesn't seem enthusiastic or positive; instead, it's somewhat dismissive of the value or quality of the content.\n\nSo putting this together, the sentiment seems to be on the negative side but not extremely so. The use of \"super-sized\" adds to the idea that it's more than just an infomercial\u2014it's a lot like one, which might make it feel excessive or overly sales-focused without offering much else. Therefore, I think this leans towards being negative.\n\nConsidering the scale where 0 is very negative and 1 is negative, I'd rate this as 1 because while there's a negative sentiment, it doesn't seem extremely harsh. It's more of a criticism than outright hostility.\n</think>\n\nThe text describes something as just a big advertisement, which is not very impressive but isn't overly hostile. So, the sentiment is negative.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 2, 42.66404029401019], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It says it's one of the most plain and unimaginative romantic comedies they've ever seen. The words \"plain\" and \"unimaginative\" stand out as negative descriptors. Plain suggests something lacking in creativity or interest, while unimaginative implies a lack of originality.\n\nI should consider the context. Romantic comedies can vary widely, but describing one as plain and unimaginative is definitely not a compliment. It's pointing out that the movie lacks depth and creativity, which are important aspects for this genre. So, people watching it might feel disappointed because they expect something engaging and innovative from a romantic comedy.\n\nThe phrase \"one of the most\" emphasizes how strongly the speaker feels about it being among the worst examples in its category. This intensifies the negativity. There's no positive language here; everything points to dissatisfaction and criticism.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the sentiment is clearly negative. Now, I need to decide if it's a 0 (very negative) or just a 1 (negative). Since the text uses strong adjectives but doesn't use superlatives beyond \"most,\" it might not be the absolute worst possible sentiment. However, considering how strongly it's worded, it leans towards being very negative.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about whether \"plain\" and \"unimaginative\" are as strong as they seem. Could someone find a romantic comedy plain but still enjoy it? Possibly, but in this context, the speaker is clearly unimpressed. The combination of both adjectives makes it more severe than just a minor negative.\n\nTherefore, I think 0 (very negative) would be appropriate here because the language used strongly conveys disappointment and criticism without any mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is very negative due to the use of strong critical adjectives like \"plain\" and \"unimaginative,\" indicating significant dissatisfaction. \n\nAnswer: 0", 0, 1, 43.66197464699508], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me read the text again: \"Much of what we see is horrible but it's also undeniably exceedingly clever.\" Hmm, that sentence has two parts connected by 'but.' The first part says something negative\u2014\"horrible\"\u2014and the second part contradicts that with something positive\u2014\"undeniably exceedingly clever.\"\n\nSo, I need to weigh these two sentiments. On one hand, \"horrible\" is a strong negative word. That suggests that there's a significant negative component. But then it's immediately balanced by a very strong positive descriptor: \"exceedingly clever.\" The use of \"undeniably\" also emphasizes that the cleverness is undeniable, which might mean that despite the initial negativity, the positive aspect is more impactful.\n\nNow, thinking about how sentiment analysis usually works, when there are both negative and positive sentiments in a sentence, it's often a matter of intensity or emphasis. Here, the positives are stressed with \"undeniably\" and \"exceedingly,\" which are strong modifiers. The negatives are just \"horrible,\" without any additional intensifiers.\n\nSo, maybe the overall sentiment isn't purely positive because there is a negative element. But the positive part seems to counterbalance it. In some cases, when two sentiments are balanced but one is more emphasized, the overall sentiment might lean towards neutral or slightly positive.\n\nAlternatively, considering that both aspects are present and each is strong in their own way, maybe the sentiment comes out as neutral because they cancel each other out. However, since the positive part uses stronger modifiers, perhaps it tips the scale a little towards positive but not extremely so.\n\nI'm thinking about how to map this on the 0-4 scale. 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The text isn't entirely negative or positive; it's mixed. However, since the positive part uses stronger language, maybe it leans towards positive but not extremely. So perhaps a 3 for positive.\n\nBut wait, could it be considered as neutral because both sentiments are presented without one clearly dominating? Alternatively, does the structure of the sentence\u2014\"but it's also undeniably exceedingly clever\"\u2014imply that despite the horrible aspects, the cleverness is more notable? That might make the overall sentiment slightly positive. So 3 makes sense.\n\nI'm leaning towards 2 or 3. Since the positives are emphasized more with \"undeniably\" and \"exceedingly,\" maybe it's a 3. But I don't want to overstate it because the negative is still present. Maybe 2, but considering the emphasis on cleverness, perhaps 3.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 3, 58.09826714199153], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user wants me to classify it into one of five categories: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. Let's break down the given text step by step.\n\nThe first part says, \"even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity did n't fade...\" So, they're talking about a film with young actors and themes of campus depravity. The word \"enticing\" suggests something positive or appealing, but it's followed by a negative point.\n\nNext, \"...amid the deliberate, tiresome ugliness,\" which clearly indicates a negative sentiment. Words like \"deliberate\" and \"tiresome\" show that whatever is happening in the film is not enjoyable and seems forced.\n\nThen, it says, \"it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest.\" The use of \"rendered tedious\" again points towards something negative. They're criticizing Avary for not creating an engaging storyline, which further emphasizes the dissatisfaction.\n\nPutting it all together: The text starts with a slightly positive note about young actors and the film's premise but quickly turns negative by describing the film as tiresome and the story as lacking drama. The overall sentiment leans heavily towards negative because of the strong critical language used throughout.\n\nI don't see any neutral elements here; the focus is on pointing out flaws in the film's execution. There's no balance between positive and negative aspects mentioned.

The phrase \"no big whoop\" sounds like disappointment; it's not exciting or impressive. Then, \"nothing new to see\" suggests that the content was unoriginal or repetitive, which is a negative point.\n\nNext, \"zero thrills\" indicates that there were no exciting parts, so that's another negative aspect. The mention of \"too many flashbacks\" might mean the pacing was off or it felt disjointed, adding to the negative sentiment. Finally, a \"choppy ending\" implies that the conclusion wasn't smooth or satisfying, which is definitely negative.\n\nPutting it all together, every part of this sentence points towards dissatisfaction with the film. The language used is quite critical and expresses multiple issues without any positive remarks. So, considering the scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, I think 0 is appropriate here because the sentiment is clearly very negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses strongly negative words like \"bad film\" and describes several flaws. \n\nAnswer: 0", 0, 0, 28.188674222008558], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence starts by mentioning that the film was partly made in Canada, which seems like just a factual statement without any emotional tone. Then it moves on to talk about \"paid in full,\" which is likely referring to a movie or show.\n\nThe key part here is the phrase \"has clever ways of capturing inner-city life during the Reagan years.\" The word \"clever\" stands out as a positive adjective, indicating that the film does an intelligent or skillful job. Additionally, describing it as capturing inner-city life suggests that the portrayal is accurate and insightful.\n\nThere's no negative language in this text. Words like \"clever,\" \"capturing,\" and the overall structure don't indicate any dissatisfaction or negativity. Instead, it seems to be a complimentary statement about how the film portrays its subject matter.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment here is positive because of the use of \"clever\" and the appreciation for how the film captures inner-city life. It doesn't go into extremes like \"amazing\" or \"brilliant,\" which might push it to a 4, but \"clever\" suggests a solid positive sentiment without being overly enthusiastic.\n\nTherefore, I think the appropriate score here is 3, which represents a positive sentiment.\n</think>\n\nThe text highlights the film's clever portrayal of inner-city life, using positive language. \n\n3", 3, 3, 37.127224025985925], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence provided is \"the riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make love a joy to behold.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down this sentence to understand its sentiment. Let's look at the adjectives used: \"riveting\" suggests something that captures attention and is engaging. \"Incredibly flexible\" implies a high level of skill or adaptability in the cast. The phrase \"make love a joy to behold\" directly states that love is being depicted in an enjoyable way.\n\nPutting this together, the overall tone seems very positive. There are no negative words here; instead, the focus is on how impressive and joyful the performances are. So I should rate this higher on the positivity scale.\n\nLooking at the options, 4 represents very positive sentiment, which fits perfectly because of the strong positive adjectives used.

The sentence starts with \"the pace and the visuals are so hyped up\"\u2014\"hyped up\" usually means something is exciting or energetic, which leans positive. But then it says \"that a curious sense of menace informs everything.\" \"Menace\" has a negative connotation because it implies threat or danger.\n\nSo, there's a mix here. On one hand, the pace and visuals are hyped, which could be seen as positive aspects. On the other hand, the overall mood is menacing, which isn't positive. The word \"curious\" modifies \"menace,\" making it intriguing but still negative in context.\n\nPutting this together, the sentence describes something that's intense and maybe thrilling because of the pace and visuals, but the underlying tone is ominous or foreboding due to the sense of menace. So while there are elements that could be positive (like excitement), the overall sentiment seems more on the negative side because of the menacing aspect.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The sentence has both elements but leans towards the negative due to the menace. However, it's not extremely negative; there's a mix with the hyped visuals and pace. So maybe it's slightly negative but not the most intense.\n\nI think it should be classified as 1 (negative).

Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, looking at the words used: \"Asian,\" \"neo-realist,\" and \"treasure.\" The term \"treasure\" is definitely positive because it implies something valuable or precious. That gives a strong hint towards a positive sentiment.\n\nNext, \"neo-realist\" might refer to a style or genre that's respected in certain circles, but on its own, it doesn't carry a strong emotional connotation\u2014it\u2019s more descriptive. The word \"Asian\" here is likely referring to the cultural origin, which again, without negative modifiers, isn't contributing much beyond context.\n\nPutting it all together, the phrase seems to be highlighting something as a precious asset within the Asian neo-realist category. There's no overtly negative language, so I don't think it's neutral either. It feels more enthusiastic than just positive, so maybe it's leaning towards very positive.\n\nI should consider if there are any nuances I'm missing. Sometimes, words can have double meanings or cultural connotations that affect sentiment. But in this case, \"treasure\" is pretty straightforward as a compliment. \n\nSo, putting all these observations together, the sentiment expressed is very positive.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 4, 27.142003701010253], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe sentence is: \"just how these families interact may surprise you.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for any positive or negative words. The word \"surprise\" catches my eye. Now, \"surprise\" can be neutral because it doesn't inherently have a positive or negative connotation\u2014it just indicates something unexpected. But sometimes, the context around it might imply whether it's good or bad.\n\nIn this case, there's no clear indication of whether the surprise is pleasant or unpleasant. It could mean that the interaction is surprising in a good way or a bad way. Without more context about how they interact\u2014like if they're happy or having conflicts\u2014it's hard to determine.\n\nThe other words are \"just,\" \"how,\" \"these families,\" \"interact,\" and \"may.\" None of these carry any obvious positive or negative sentiment on their own. The sentence is more observational than anything else, just stating that the interaction might surprise someone.\n\nSince there's no strong emotional language, it doesn't lean towards being very positive (4) or very negative (0). It also isn't clearly positive (3) or negative (1), because those would require a more definite sentiment.

The user wants a classification from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the text. \"Cold porridge\" usually doesn't sound good because cold food can be unappetizing. Porridge itself is often associated with comfort, but when it's cold, that might not be appealing to everyone. So the base image here isn't super negative, but it's not positive either.\n\nThen there's \"only the odd enjoyably chewy lump.\" The word \"enjoyably\" suggests a positive aspect, but it's qualified by \"only the odd,\" which means this is rare or uncommon. So while there's something positive mentioned, it's minimal and overshadowed by the overall description of cold porridge.\n\nPutting that together, the sentiment seems mostly neutral with a slight negative leaning because the main comparison is to cold porridge, which isn't favorable. The small positive element doesn't tip the balance enough for it to be neutral or even slightly positive.

It mentions it's a culture-clash comedy, which immediately makes me think it's meant to be funny. The phrase \"in addition to being very funny\" emphasizes that humor is a key aspect. So that's definitely a positive point.\n\nBut then it talks about capturing some discomfort and embarrassment. Those are negative emotions. Being a bumbling American in Europe could imply awkwardness or not fitting in, which aren't pleasant feelings. However, since this is a comedy, the intention isn't to dwell on these negatives but rather to use them for humor. So while there's an element of negativity, it's balanced by the comedic context.\n\nI should consider how these elements balance each other. The primary focus seems to be on the humor, which suggests a positive sentiment overall. But the mention of discomfort and embarrassment adds some nuance, making it not entirely positive without any drawbacks.\n\nOn a scale from 0 to 4, where 2 is neutral, I need to decide if this leans more towards positive or negative. Since the text highlights that it's very funny but also acknowledges some negative feelings, I think it's still on the positive side because the humor takes precedence. However, it's not extremely positive (which would be a 4) because of the acknowledged discomfort.\n\nSo, balancing both aspects, the sentiment is more positive than neutral but not extremely so.

By avoiding this, Schrader's approach seems more understated.\n\nThe next part says he uses \"subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view.\" Subtle suggests that these methods are gentle, nuanced, and perhaps more effective because they don't come on too strong. Ironies can add depth to a narrative, making the story more engaging and thought-provoking rather than just delivering a message in a straightforward way.\n\nSo, putting it together: Schrader is praised for not being heavy-handed but instead using more refined techniques. The overall tone seems positive because it's highlighting his effective use of subtlety and artistry. However, the sentiment isn't extremely effusive; it's more about appreciation rather than glowing praise.\n\nI think 3 (positive) makes sense here because the statement is definitely complimentary without being overly enthusiastic.

There's no negative language or sarcasm that I can see, so the sentiment is clearly on the positive side. \n\nNow, considering the intensity: \"looks great\" is quite strong, as is \"solid acting.\" However, \"neat premise\" might be a bit less intense but still positive.

The word \"without\" suggests something missing, which could be negative.\n\n\"Innocuous\" means harmless, so that's neutral. It doesn't carry much emotion on its own.\n\n\"Flavorless\" definitely has a negative connotation because it implies the food lacks taste, which is not desirable in a dessert.\n\nPutting it all together: The sentence compares the snow cone to shave ice without toppings, highlighting that it's both harmless and lacking flavor. This suggests dissatisfaction or disappointment with the product.\n\nConsidering the scale:\n- Very positive (4): Doesn't apply here because there are negative aspects mentioned.\n- Positive (3): Also not fitting since the focus is on what's missing rather than any positives.\n- Neutral (2): Not quite, as there's a clear criticism about being flavorless.\n- Negative (1): Possible, but maybe it's more towards very negative.\n- Very negative (0): The mention of being flavorless and comparing to something without toppings leans towards strong dissatisfaction.\n\nI think the sentiment is more on the negative side. Maybe 1 or 0. But since \"flavorless\" is a significant criticism, perhaps 0 is too harsh.

The sentence is about an Israeli documentary, specifically talking about Pasach 'Ke Burstein and his family. \n\nFirst, let me break down the words used. \"Rich\" generally has a positive connotation\u2014it suggests something full or abundant, which is good. Then there's \"bittersweet,\" which can be tricky because it implies a mix of happiness and sadness. However, in many contexts, especially when describing a documentary, \"bittersweet\" might highlight emotional depth rather than negativity. \n\nThe phrase \"transcends ethnic lines\" sounds positive. It suggests that the documentary is able to go beyond or bridge differences between different ethnic groups, which is a compliment. So, putting it all together: the documentary is described as rich and bittersweet, which are both somewhat positive, and it's praised for transcending ethnic lines.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. Even \"bittersweet\" isn't outright negative; it's more about complexity. The overall tone seems appreciative and complimentary. Therefore, I think the sentiment is positive but not extremely so. On a scale from 0 to 4, that would probably be a 3.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses words like \"rich,\" \"bittersweet,\" and mentions that the documentary transcends ethnic lines, which are all positive or neutral in nature. There's no negative language present.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify sentiment keywords**: The key adjectives here are \"rich\" and \"bittersweet.\" While \"bittersweet\" can imply a mix of emotions, it often carries a positive connotation when describing something emotionally engaging or deep.\n\n2. **Assess the overall tone**: The sentence is appreciative of the documentary's ability to transcend ethnic lines, which indicates a positive sentiment.\n\n3. **Determine the intensity**: Since there are no extremely strong positive words like \"excellent\" or \"amazing,\" and the mention of \"bittersweet\" adds some nuance without being negative, the sentiment is moderately positive.\n\n**Answer:** 3", 3, 3, 42.608866199007025], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user has given me a sentence about a movie remake, specifically mentioning Mctiernan's version compared to the original. I need to classify its sentiment on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nFirst, I'll read through the sentence again: \"Mctiernan 's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious.\"\n\nSo, breaking this down. The first part says that Mctiernan's remake is \"lighter on its feet.\" That sounds positive because being lighter might mean more energetic or less heavy-handed. But then the comparison to the original is made: the original was \"sober-minded\" and \"as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino.\" Wait, a tap-dancing rhino? Rhinos are big and not known for grace. So that's probably a negative comment on the original, saying it wasn't very graceful despite being sober-minded.\n\nBut then comes the\u8f6c\u6298: even though the remake is lighter, it's \"just as boring and as obvious.\" That's definitely negative. The word \"boring\" is clearly negative, and \"obvious\" suggests lack of creativity or depth. So the remake doesn't escape these flaws; it's still bad in those aspects.\n\nPutting this together: The first part hints at a possible positive point for the remake, but then immediately contrasts that by saying it shares the same negatives as the original. The negative words like \"boring\" and \"obvious\" carry more weight here because they directly criticize the remake's quality.\n\nI should consider if there are any other cues. The structure of the sentence starts with a potential positive but ends with strong negatives, so overall sentiment leans negative. But how much? Since it's not overly harsh beyond calling it boring and obvious, maybe a 1 for negative.\n\nWait, does \"lighter on its feet\" count as somewhat positive? Maybe a 2 if neutral, but since the latter part is more negative, I think it's still in the negative range. So probably a 1.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 1, 45.997238028998254], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The key terms here are \"heartbreakingly\" and \"drably.\" Hmm, those both seem negative. But wait, the rest of the sentence is about Polanski capturing places from his childhood, which might be a neutral or positive action depending on context.\n\n\"Heartbreakingly\" suggests something sad or emotionally heavy. That's definitely leaning towards negative. Then there's \"drably,\" which I think is supposed to be \"dreariness\" or just \"drearily.\" Either way, it conveys a sense of gloom or bleakness. So both adverbs are pointing towards negative emotions.\n\nNow, the structure of the sentence: Polanski is looking back on childhood places and capturing them in a way that's freeing from artifacts. That part could be neutral or positive because he's revisiting memories. But the latter part about showing them \"heartbreakingly drably\" adds an emotional layer that makes it more negative.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment seems to be negative but not extremely so. There's sadness implied without extreme anger or despair. So on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, this would probably fall into category 1 (negative) rather than 0 because while it's sad, it's not overly harsh or severe.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 2, 33.83685462200083], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts with a positive statement about Perry and his character\u2014calling him \"good\" and his character \"interesting.\" That's clearly positive. But then there's a \"but,\" which often signals a contrast or negative point.\n\nAfter the \"but,\" it talks about \"Serving Sara.\" The phrase used is \"hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff.\" \"Silly fluff\" suggests that the content isn't substantial or meaningful\u2014it's just light, maybe even trivial. So this part is negative because it's dismissing the show as lacking depth.\n\nNow, I have two parts: one positive and one negative. The question is how to weigh them. Since the sentence starts with a positive note but then qualifies it with a stronger negative about the show, the overall sentiment leans more towards negative. However, because there is a positive element, it's not extremely negative.\n\nSo considering the scale, 0 is very negative, and 1 is negative. I think this falls into 1 because while there are both elements, the negative part about \"Serving Sara\" is significant enough to tip it into negative territory without being extremely so.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is primarily negative due to the criticism of \"Serving Sara,\" despite the positive mention of Perry. \n\nOutput: 1", 1, 1, 34.7015265400114], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text provided is \"decent but dull.\"\n\nHmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I need to analyze each word in the sentence. The first word is \"decent,\" which generally has a positive connotation. It means something is good enough or satisfactory. So that leans towards positive.\n\nThen there's \"but.\" This is a conjunction often used to contrast two ideas. It sets up an expectation that what comes next might be a bit of a downer, so I should pay attention to the second part.\n\nThe last word is \"dull,\" which is definitely negative. Dull means boring or uninteresting. So even though something is decent, it's not exciting or engaging.\n\nPutting this together, the sentence is expressing a mixed sentiment. The use of \"decent\" suggests some level of approval, but \"dull\" brings down that positivity. Since the two adjectives are contrasting each other, I think the overall sentiment isn't extremely positive or negative.\n\nNow, looking at the scale provided: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 is neutral, 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive. The sentence isn't strongly leaning in either direction because of the contrast.

The text provided is: \"a lovably old-school hollywood confection.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the words used here. \"Lovably\" seems like a positive adjective because it suggests something that evokes love or affection. It's not extremely strong, but it's definitely a positive term. Then there's \"old-school Hollywood,\" which refers to classic films or styles from earlier times in Hollywood history. Depending on context, this could be neutral or positive, especially if the person appreciates traditional storytelling or filmmaking techniques.\n\nThe word \"confection\" is interesting. In culinary terms, it usually means something sweet and pleasant, like candy or a dessert. When applied to movies, it often carries a positive connotation, implying that the film is delightful, charming, and perhaps even a bit light-hearted or fun. So combining \"lovably\" with \"old-school Hollywood confection\" gives me the sense that the speaker is using these words in a complimentary way.\n\nPutting it all together, the text seems to be expressing a positive sentiment about whatever is being referred to (probably a movie). The use of \"lovable\" and \"confection\" both contribute to a warm, pleasant feeling. However, since there's no superlatives like \"amazingly\" or \"fantastic,\" it doesn't reach the very high end of positivity.\n\nSo considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 is neutral, 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive.

In a movie review context, this could imply that the plot isn't clear or makes little sense, which is usually a negative point. \n\nNext is \"self-indulgent.\" This term often refers to something that's overly focused on its own style or creativity without considering the audience. In movies, self-indulgence can mean the film is more about the director's ego than telling a good story, which many viewers might find off-putting. That's another negative point.\n\nThen there's \"goofy,\" which usually means silly or overly playful. Depending on context, this could be positive or neutral. However, when combined with words like \"opaque\" and \"self-indulgent,\" it seems to add to the criticism. It suggests that the movie isn't just unclear but also overly silly in a way that doesn't work well.\n\nThe phrase \"an excuse for a movie\" is pretty strong. It implies that the film isn't really a proper movie at all, just something thrown together without much thought or effort. This is definitely a negative sentiment because it's dismissing the entire premise of the movie as lacking substance.\n\nPutting it all together: The text uses several negative adjectives and a dismissive phrase to describe the movie. Words like \"opaque,\" \"self-indulgent,\" \"goofy,\" and \"excuse for a movie\" all contribute to a very negative sentiment. \n\nI don't see any positive words here. All descriptors are critical, so the sentiment isn't neutral or positive. It's clearly on the negative side. Since 0 is very negative and 1 is just negative, I need to determine which fits better.\n\nThe use of \"the most\" intensifies each adjective, making each criticism stronger.

So, it's not just slightly negative but quite strongly so. \n\nTherefore, 0 (very negative) would be the appropriate classification here.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is very negative due to the use of critical adjectives and dismissive phrases.

Let's break it down. The text describes middle-class Arkansas people as being into monster trucks, which might be a neutral or even positive thing for some, but then it adds \"good ol' boys\" which can have a derogatory connotation implying they're perhaps uneducated or old-fashioned. Then there are the peroxide blond honeys\u2014using \"peroxide blond\" could imply that they dye their hair and maybe are not as intelligent or are stereotypically vapid. \n\nThe last part says their knowledge comes from TV reruns and supermarket tabloids, which are often considered lowbrow or not serious sources of information. So the overall description seems to be painting a somewhat unflattering picture of middle-class Arkansas, using stereotypes that might come off as mocking or dismissive.\n\nSo, considering all this, it's likely negative. The use of terms like \"good ol' boys\" and \"peroxide blond honeys\" along with their knowledge sources suggests the speaker is looking down on them. But I'm not sure if it's extremely negative (0) or just negative (1). Since it uses stereotypes but isn't overly harsh, maybe it's a 1.\n</think>\n\nThe text paints a somewhat unflattering picture of middle-class Arkansas using derogatory terms and mocking their knowledge sources, indicating a negative sentiment.

On its own, \"masala\" doesn't carry any sentiment\u2014it's just a descriptor.\n\nSo putting them together, the phrase is saying that the masala is tasty. That sounds positive because it's highlighting a favorable quality. There are no negative words or context here to suggest otherwise. The sentence is straightforward and complimentary about the masala.\n\nI should also consider if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but in this case, it seems genuine. The user is likely expressing satisfaction with the taste of the masala. Therefore, the sentiment isn't just positive; it's quite strong because \"tasty\" is a direct compliment.\n\nConsidering the scale, 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit here. Negative (1) also isn't right because there's no negativity. Neutral (2) might be considered if the statement was more factual without emotion, but \"tasty\" adds positivity.

That's a positive statement. The word \"excellent\" definitely carries a positive sentiment.\n\nThen it uses a comma and says \"but he does not give the transcendent performance.\" Now, \"transcendent\" here suggests something really good or amazing that's missing. So saying he doesn't provide that is negative. It implies that his performance wasn't as great as expected or needed.\n\nThe next part talks about overcoming gaps in character development and story logic. Gaps usually mean there are shortcomings or weaknesses. So pointing out these gaps is a negative point.\n\nPutting it all together: The text starts positive by praising Franco, but then criticizes his performance for not being good enough to fix issues in the story and characters. This creates a mixed sentiment, but leaning more towards neutral because while there's both praise and criticism, the overall tone might balance out.\n\nSo considering the scale:\n- 0: Very Negative\n- 1: Negative\n- 2: Neutral\n- 3: Positive\n- 4: Very Positive\n\nThe positive part is strong with \"excellent choice,\" but it's countered by pointing out shortcomings in his performance and story issues.

However, sometimes when someone mentions one aspect as a triumph and another as a failure, they're trying to say that despite some strengths, there's a significant flaw. So maybe the overall sentiment is slightly negative because the storytelling is seen as a major issue.\n\nAlternatively, if the positive part is more emphasized than the negative, it might be considered neutral. But in this case, both parts are given equal weight with \"triumph\" and \"failure.\" So I'm torn between neutral (2) or slightly negative (1).\n\nWait, but looking again, the user starts with \"yes,\" which could imply agreement on something positive, but then immediately follows with a significant downside.

It suggests that the artist's work or message evokes strong emotions, particularly on the sadder side.\n\nNext, looking at the rest of the sentence: \"taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us.\" The fact that the artist is making an effort indicates dedication and care, which are positive traits. Sharing impressions about life and loss ties back into the poignant aspect mentioned earlier\u2014topics like loss can be heavy and emotional.\n\nSo putting it all together: The sentence acknowledges the artist's advanced age and the emotions tied to their work. While \"poignant\" leans towards negative sentiment due to its association with sadness, there's also a sense of\u656c\u610f (respect) for the artist's efforts to connect and share his experiences. This balance might make the overall sentiment not entirely positive but perhaps leaning towards neutral or slightly positive.\n\nNow, considering the scale provided:\n0 - Very Negative\n1 - Negative\n2 - Neutral\n3 - Positive\n4 - Very Positive\n\nThe use of \"poignant\" could push it towards a negative score, but the context isn't overtly negative. It's more reflective and evocative. The artist is sharing his thoughts, which is a positive action, even if the content is about loss. Therefore, the sentiment might not be neutral but rather slightly on the positive side because of the effort and the depth of sharing.\n\nI should also think about other words that could influence this. Words like \"effort,\" \"share,\" and \"impressions\" don't carry strong negative connotations. They suggest engagement and communication, which are generally viewed positively.\n\nSo weighing it out: The emotional weight from \"poignant\" might make it a 1 (Negative), but the overall tone is more reflective than harshly negative. Therefore, I'm leaning towards 2 (Neutral) because while there's sadness involved, it's balanced by respect and appreciation for the artist's contributions.\n\nWait, maybe another angle: Sometimes, \"poignant\" can also be seen as a testament to something deeply meaningful. In that sense, it might not just be negative but also highlight the significance of the artist's work. This could tip the scale towards a slightly positive sentiment because it's acknowledging the depth and importance of what the artist is sharing.\n\nIn some contexts, \"poignant\" can carry both sadness and beauty. So perhaps the sentiment isn't purely negative but has an underlying appreciation that makes it more neutral or even leaning positive.\n\nConsidering all this, I think 2 (Neutral) would be appropriate because while there's a touch of sadness, it's balanced by respect for the artist's efforts and the meaningfulness of his work. It doesn't lean heavily in either direction but sits somewhere in the middle.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 3, 72.89577136101434], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence provided is \"an enjoyable , if occasionally flawed , experiment .\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the words used. The word \"enjoyable\" has a positive connotation\u2014it suggests that something was pleasant or satisfying. That makes me lean towards a positive sentiment.\n\nNext, there's \"if occasionally flawed.\" This phrase introduces some nuance. While the main adjective is positive (\"enjoyable\"), it's qualified by saying that there are occasional flaws. The word \"flawed\" itself is negative, implying imperfection or shortcomings. However, since it's preceded by \"occasionally,\" it softens the impact a bit\u2014meaning the flaws aren't constant or pervasive.\n\nSo putting it together: The sentence starts with a positive descriptor but then adds a caution that there are some negatives involved. It seems like the speaker is balancing both aspects, suggesting that overall they had a good experience despite some minor issues.\n\nNow, considering the scale from 0 to 4. Since \"enjoyable\" is definitely positive, it's more than neutral (2). The mention of flaws might bring it down a bit from a very high positive (like 3 or 4), but not enough to make it negative. \n\nIf I think about similar expressions, when someone says something was good but had some issues, they usually don't mean it's bad overall. So the sentiment is still positive, just tempered by the flaws.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this as a 3 (positive) because while there are shortcomings mentioned, the dominant feeling expressed is enjoyment.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses an overall positive sentiment due to the use of \"enjoyable,\" despite mentioning occasional flaws. \n\nAnswer: 3", 3, 3, 38.50045119799324], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The main point seems to be about how difficult it is for another director to make his wife appear negatively in a significant film. So, the focus is on the wife looking bad. That's a negative aspect.\n\nThe phrase \"hard to imagine\" suggests that what's being described is unusual or unlikely. It implies that such an action (making his wife look bad) is not something other directors would do, which could mean it's either rare or perhaps even frowned upon.\n\nPutting it together, the statement criticizes someone for making his wife look bad in a movie, which is a negative portrayal. The use of \"so bad\" emphasizes that this was a significant misstep. So overall, the sentiment here is negative because it's pointing out an unfortunate situation where someone's spouse was portrayed negatively.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, etc. Since the statement clearly has a critical tone and points out a downside without any balancing positives, I think it falls into the negative category but isn't extremely so.

The beginning says that something (probably a movie or book) is \"many things,\" listing genres like a stoner midnight flick, sci-fi deconstruction, and gay fantasia. These are all descriptors, but they don't immediately indicate sentiment\u2014they're more about categorization.\n\nThen the sentence shifts to say that above all else, it's a love story as sanguine as its title. The word \"sanguine\" here is key. I know \"sanguine\" typically means cheerful, optimistic, or confident. So when describing a love story as sanguine, it suggests positivity and warmth.\n\nPutting this together, the text isn't just categorizing the work but also praising it by highlighting that its core theme is a positive and hopeful love story. Even though it mentions various genres which might have neutral or mixed connotations depending on context, the emphasis at the end is clearly positive.\n\nI don't see any negative words here\u2014everything seems to lean towards a favorable view. So the sentiment should be on the higher side. Since \"sanguine\" adds a strong positive element, I think it goes beyond just being positive (which would be 3) into very positive territory. Therefore, the classification should be 4.\n</think>\n\nThe text describes the work as various genres but emphasizes its core theme as a hopeful love story, using the positive term \"sanguine.\" This indicates a very positive sentiment.\n\nAnswer: 4", 4, 3, 42.10830347100273], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Then there's \"documentary,\" which is neutral on its own but in this context might be highlighting real events. The phrase \"reveals how deep the antagonism lies\" suggests that there's significant conflict or opposition present. \n\nNow, looking at \"war-torn Jerusalem\"\u2014that definitely has negative connotations because it refers to a place affected by war and turmoil. So putting it all together, while \"gripping\" might hint at some level of engagement or emotional intensity, the overall focus is on antagonism and war, which are negative themes.\n\nSo I think this leans towards a negative sentiment but not extremely so. It's more about showing the reality of conflict rather than being overly harsh.

The text provided is \"... hypnotically dull.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down each word. \"Hypnotically\" usually has a neutral to slightly positive connotation because it relates to being relaxed or in a trance-like state, which can be pleasant. However, when paired with \"dull,\" the meaning shifts.\n\n\"Dull\" is clearly negative. It describes something that's boring, uninteresting, or lacking excitement. So putting them together, \"hypnotically dull\" seems to convey a sense of being so boring that it's almost hypnotic in its tediousness.\n\nConsidering sentiment scores, very positive would be 4 and very negative would be 0. Since the phrase is negative but not extremely so, I'm leaning towards either 1 or maybe even 2 if someone interprets it neutrally. But since \"dull\" is a strong negative word, I think it's better to go with 1 (negative) as the sentiment.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses \"hypnotically dull,\" which combines a neutral term with a clearly negative one.

The text is: \"it's hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you've seen the remake first.\"\n\nFirst, I'll read through the sentence carefully. It seems like the speaker is talking about judging a movie, specifically \"ringu,\" which I think refers to \"Ringu\" or \"The Ring.\" They mention that it's difficult to judge this film fairly because they've already seen the remake.\n\nBreaking down the sentiment here: The phrase \"hard to fairly judge\" suggests some difficulty in evaluating something. The reason given is that one has seen the remake first, which might imply that the remake influenced their perception of the original film. \n\nI should consider if there's any explicit positive or negative emotion expressed. There doesn't seem to be any strong words indicating anger, disappointment, or enthusiasm. Instead, it's more about a challenge in making an unbiased judgment.\n\nThe sentence is stating a fact without expressing personal feelings strongly. It's pointing out a potential bias due to seeing the remake first, which could affect one's ability to judge the original fairly. There's no overt positivity or negativity here\u2014just an observation about difficulty in evaluation.\n\nTherefore, since there are no strong positive or negative emotions expressed, and it's more of an objective statement about a challenge, the sentiment is neutral. Neutral would correspond to 2.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment of the text is neutral because it presents an observational challenge without expressing clear positive or negative emotion. \n\nAnswer: 2", 2, 2, 32.793358881026506], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

First, they mention that Pimental feminized the Farrelly brothers' comedy. The word \"feminized\" could be neutral or slightly negative depending on context. However, the second part says it's a \"rather poor imitation,\" which clearly has a negative connotation.\n\nSo, combining both parts, the sentiment seems to lean towards negative. But is it just negative (1) or very negative (0)? The phrase \"rather poor\" suggests a strong negative, but maybe not extremely so. It doesn't use superlatives like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" which might make it more moderate in negativity.\n\nConsidering the options, 0 is reserved for very negative sentiments, while 1 is just negative. Since \"poor imitation\" isn't the harshest criticism, I think it's better classified as 1 rather than 0.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 2, 25.35084865198587], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is: \"skip this dreck , rent animal house and go back to the source .\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the words used. \"Skip this dreck\" \u2013 \"dreck\" means something that's worthless or rubbish. So this part is clearly negative. They're telling someone to skip whatever they're currently looking at because it's not good.\n\nNext, \"rent animal house and go back to the source.\" Animal House is a well-known comedy movie, so suggesting someone rent it might be positive if they like that genre. However, the way it's phrased here seems more like a suggestion to move away from whatever \"this dreck\" refers to, implying that the current thing isn't as good as Animal House.\n\nSo putting it together: They're dismissing the current option as bad (\"dreck\") and suggesting something else (Animal House) as better. The sentiment is negative towards what they're currently referring to but positive about the alternative. However, since the main focus seems to be on dismissing the current thing, I think the overall sentiment leans more negative.\n\nConsidering the options: 0 for very negative, 1 for negative, etc. The use of \"dreck\" is quite strong, indicating a dislike or frustration with what's being referred to. So maybe it's a 0? Or perhaps just a 1 since they're not overly aggressive beyond that word.\n\nWait, but the suggestion to go back to the source (which I assume is Animal House) might indicate nostalgia or preference for something else. But the main sentiment expressed is about skipping the current thing because it's bad. So overall, the negative part is stronger here.\n\nSo maybe it's a 0? Or just a strong negative but not extremely so. \"Dreck\" is pretty harsh, which would lean towards very negative (0). But sometimes people use strong language without meaning it to be extremely negative. Hmm.\n\nI think in this context, since they're advising others to skip something and go back to an older source, the sentiment is quite negative about the current thing but positive about the alternative. However, the classification is based on the overall sentiment expressed. Since the focus is on dismissing the current content as \"dreck,\" which is very negative, I'd say it's a 0.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the balance between the two makes it just negative rather than very negative. The main action is advising to skip something bad and go back to a better source, so maybe it's more negative than extremely negative because while \"dreck\" is strong, the overall advice isn't as extreme as other very negative sentiments might be.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about how negative each part is: \"skip this dreck\" is clearly negative. Then the rest is suggesting an alternative which is positive. But since the sentiment is about the current thing, it's negative towards that. So maybe a 1 for negative instead of 0 because while strong, it's not extremely so beyond just dismissing something.\n\nI'm a bit torn between 0 and 1 here. \"Dreck\" is quite harsh, but without more context, I might lean towards 0 as very negative.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is classified as 0 (very negative) because of the strong negative language used to dismiss the current content.\n\n**Answer:** 0", 0, 1, 72.76146500799223], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase starts with \"confident,\" which is a positive adjective. Then \"richly acted\" \u2013 that\u2019s also positive because it complements the acting. Next, \"emotionally devastating.\" Hmm, this one's trickier. Devastating can imply something sad or intense, but in the context of film reviews, it might mean it had a strong emotional impact, which is often seen as a good thing because it means the movie affected people deeply.\n\nThen it says \"piece of work\" and calls it 2002's \"first great film.\" Both \"great\" and being called a significant film in that year are clearly positive. So even though \"emotionally devastating\" could be read as negative, in this context, it's likely highlighting the film's powerful effect rather than its negativity.\n\nPutting it all together: most of the adjectives used are positive. The only potentially negative word is \"devastating,\" but given the surrounding context, it doesn't seem to indicate a negative sentiment overall. So I think the sentiment here is quite positive.\n\nI need to choose between 3 (positive) or 4 (very positive). Since all descriptors except one are clearly positive and even that ambiguous term is likely intended positively, maybe it's very positive. But sometimes people might not rate something as a 4 unless it's extremely praised without any negatives. Here, \"emotionally devastating\" could imply some emotional toll but not necessarily a negative sentiment about the film itself.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the user wants only one of those integers and given that all positive descriptors outweigh the possible neutral or slightly negative term, I think this should be a 4.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses predominantly positive language with \"confident,\" \"richly acted,\" and \"great film.\" While \"emotionally devastating\" could imply sadness, in the context of a film review, it often signifies a strong emotional impact, which is viewed positively.

It says that something is exactly what one would expect from someone named Kaos. Now, \"Kaos\" sounds like chaos, which usually has a negative connotation. Chaos implies disorder, confusion, maybe even destruction. So if someone is named Kaos, people might associate him with chaotic behavior or situations.\n\nThe phrase \"exactly what you'd expect\" suggests that whatever the context is, it's aligning with preconceived notions about this person. If the expectation is negative because of the name, then the sentiment here could be leaning towards the negative side. \n\nBut wait, does the sentence explicitly state anything positive or negative? It doesn't use any adjectives directly. It just sets up an expectation based on a name. So it's more of a neutral statement but with implications. The implication is that because his name is Kaos, certain behaviors or outcomes are expected\u2014probably negative ones.\n\nSo, considering the context, even though the sentence itself isn't outright negative, the implication based on the name is negative. Therefore, I think it's slightly negative. It doesn't express extreme negativity but a mild one. So out of the options given, 1 would be negative. \n\nWait, could there be another interpretation? Maybe \"Kaos\" isn't meant to be associated with chaos but just as a name. However, in most contexts, people associate \"chaos\" with something bad or disruptive. Unless specified otherwise, it's safer to go with the common association.\n\nSo putting it all together, I think the sentiment is negative, so the classification should be 1.\n</think>\n\nThe text implies expectations of chaos based on the name Kaos, suggesting a mild negative sentiment.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 2, 42.67732014300418], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Words like \"may not be\" could indicate dissatisfaction or a comparison to a better past.\n\nHowever, the second part says, \"who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved.\" The word \"cognizant\" means aware or knowledgeable, which is positive. So this part is praising someone's awareness.\n\nPutting it together: There's a comparison to past works being better (slightly negative) but then praise for current filmmakers' understanding of important issues (positive). The overall sentiment seems mixed. It acknowledges that the current work might not be as good as before, but it also compliments their focus on significant cultural and moral aspects.\n\nSo considering both parts, it's leaning more neutral because while there's a mild negative comparison, there's also a positive aspect highlighted.

But then it mentions \"simple pleasures,\" which is more positive because it refers to enjoying small things.\n\nThe text says that these daily struggles and simple pleasures take over (\"usurp\") the preaching message.

So when they say it's a perfect cure, they're implying that watching the video would make someone sleepy because it's so dull.\n\nSo the sentiment here is negative because it's suggesting the content isn't engaging or enjoyable\u2014it's boring enough to cause sleepiness. The use of \"perfect\" in this context might seem positive at first glance, but when combined with \"cure for insomnia,\" it flips the meaning to something unfavorable.\n\nTherefore, considering the scale, 0 is very negative, and 1 is just negative. Since it's clearly negative but maybe not extremely so, I think it would be a 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence suggests that watching the video is so boring that it can cure insomnia, implying it's unengaging and tedious.\n\n1", 1, 0, 31.159471477993065], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It mentions that death being just a transition is a common belief across various religions. Now, thinking about this, different people might have different feelings about it. For some, believing in an afterlife or another form of existence after death can be comforting because it lessens the fear of death. So, if someone holds that belief, they might feel more at ease or positive about the idea.\n\nOn the other hand, the sentence itself is a statement of fact\u2014it's saying that this belief is common, not expressing an opinion on whether it's good or bad. But when considering sentiment, sometimes the context can imply a tone. The phrase \"merely a transition\" suggests that death isn't the end but rather a change to something else. This could be seen as positive because it downplays the finality and potential negativity associated with death.\n\nHowever, I'm also thinking about how neutral statements are perceived. Since the sentence is more informative than opinionated, it might lean towards neutral sentiment. But because the belief in a transition can offer comfort, there's a subtle positivity to it. It's not overly enthusiastic or positive, but there's an underlying sense of hope or acceptance that could make it slightly positive.\n\nSo considering all this, I think the sentiment is leaning more towards positive but isn't extremely so. It's probably around a 3 (positive) rather than a very high score like 4 because it doesn't express strong emotion. The statement is factual but has a comforting undertone which contributes to a positive sentiment.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 2, 38.5532105989987], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text provided is \"the whole affair is as predictable as can be.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to understand its components. The phrase starts with \"the whole affair,\" which refers to a situation or event. Then it says this affair is \"as predictable as can be.\" The word \"predictable\" here suggests that the outcome or nature of the affair was expected and not surprising.\n\nNow, I need to assess the sentiment. Predictability in itself isn't inherently positive or negative; it depends on context. However, when someone describes an event as predictable, they might imply a lack of excitement or originality, which can lean towards a slightly negative sentiment. But since the sentence doesn't explicitly state dissatisfaction or disappointment, just that it was expected, it's not strongly negative.\n\nConsidering the options:\n- 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit because there's no strong negativity.\n- 1 is negative; maybe possible if predictability is seen as a downside, but it's not clear enough.\n- 2 is neutral; this might be a good fit since the sentence isn't expressing emotion, just stating something about the affair.\n- 3 and 4 are positive, which don't apply here.\n\nSo, weighing these, I think the sentiment is neutral because while predictability can sometimes imply a negative connotation, in this case, it's more of an observation without emotional charge. Therefore, the sentiment is likely neutral, so the answer would be 2.\n</think>\n\nThe text describes something as predictable but doesn't express a strong positive or negative emotion.

It's saying that some episodes work and others don't. That means there's a mix of good and not-so-good experiences. So, it's not all positive or all negative.\n\nI should consider if the sentiment leans more towards positive or negative. The word \"work\" suggests that those episodes are successful, which is positive. On the flip side, saying some don't work implies they're unsuccessful, which is a negative point. \n\nSince both aspects are mentioned without any emphasis on one over the other, it seems balanced. There's no strong language indicating extreme feelings either way. It just states a fact that there's variety in quality.\n\nSo, considering this balance between positive and negative elements, I think the sentiment isn't strongly leaning towards either.

The text starts by praising Coppola's work as \"incredibly layered\" and \"stylistic,\" which are positive adjectives. That suggests the sentiment is leaning towards positive. \n\nHowever, there's a negative aspect mentioned: the film has a \"slow-paced, almost humdrum approach to character development.\" This part points out a flaw, making it somewhat negative.\n\nBut then it says that despite this drawback, the film \"still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema.\" The use of \"decent attempt\" is positive but not overly so. It doesn't outright criticize the film but acknowledges its effort.\n\nSo overall, there's both praise and criticism. The positives are more about the style and depth, while the negatives are about pacing and character development. Since the positives are highlighted first and the negatives are somewhat mitigated by the final positive note, I think the sentiment is slightly positive but not extremely so. \n\nConsidering the scale from 0 to 4, this would be a 3 because it's positive but not very positive due to the mentioned flaws.\n</think>\n\nThe text starts with positive adjectives (\"incredibly layered\" and \"stylistic\") but also mentions negative aspects like a slow pace and humdrum character development.

The input is the sentence: \"none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what sentiment classification means. It's about determining whether the text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral feeling, and in this case, it's scaled from 0 to 4 with specific labels for each number.\n\nLooking at the sentence, the key words here are \"none,\" \"fleshed-out enough,\" and \"build any interest.\" The phrase \"none of the characters or plot-lines\" suggests that neither the characters nor the plot lines are well-developed. When something isn't fleshed out enough, it usually means it's lacking depth or detail, which can make it less engaging.\n\nThe sentence is pointing out a deficiency in both character development and plot structure. This indicates dissatisfaction with how the story elements are handled. The lack of interest built implies that the reader or viewer didn't find the material compelling because these essential aspects weren't sufficiently developed.\n\nNow, considering sentiment scores:\n- 0: Very Negative\n- 1: Negative\n- 2: Neutral\n- 3: Positive\n- 4: Very Positive\n\nThe statement is clearly expressing a negative sentiment. The words \"none\" and \"not enough to build interest\" are strong indicators of dissatisfaction. It's not just a minor issue; it's pointing out that both characters and plot lines are lacking, which affects the overall engagement.\n\nSo, between 0 and 1, I need to decide how strongly negative this is. The sentiment isn't extremely harsh, but it's definitely a criticism. Since it's stating that neither the characters nor the plot are developed enough to create interest, it suggests a significant flaw. Therefore, it might lean towards being very negative because of the comprehensive failure in both aspects.\n\nBut wait, \"very negative\" would usually involve stronger language or more explicit frustration. Here, while it's a criticism, it's stated factually without intense emotion. So perhaps it's more on the negative side (1) rather than extremely so. However, considering that both characters and plot are criticized, which are major components, this could still be quite strong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's in between but closer to 0 because of the comprehensive failure mentioned. I'm a bit torn here. On one hand, it's a clear negative sentiment without extreme language; on the other, it points out significant flaws affecting both key elements, which might make it more severe.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the criticism is about two major aspects and their inability to build interest, this seems like a strong negative statement but perhaps not extremely so. So I think assigning a 0 (very negative) would be appropriate because it's highlighting a critical deficiency in essential areas that affect engagement.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment of the text is very negative due to the comprehensive criticism of both characters and plot lines failing to engage interest.\n\nAnswer: 0", 0, 1, 63.283403067005565], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the sentence. The first clause says Hoffman's performance is great. That sounds positive. But then there's a \"while,\" which often indicates a contrast or something that follows might not be as good. So after that, it mentions the subject matter goes nowhere, which seems negative.\n\nSo the sentiment isn't purely positive because of that second part. It starts positive but ends with a criticism. I need to balance these two aspects. Hoffman's performance being great is definitely a plus, making me think maybe a 3 or 4. But the subject matter going nowhere suggests it doesn't make up for that negative point.\n\nSince there are both positive and negative elements, it might lean neutral. However, the negative part about the subject not going anywhere could be significant enough to lower the sentiment more than just neutral. Maybe towards a 1 or 2.\n\nI should also consider how strong each sentiment is. \"Great\" is a strong positive word, but \"goes nowhere\" implies the story or content lacks direction or depth, which can be pretty negative. So the negatives might outweigh the positives here.\n\nPutting it all together: Hoffman's performance being great is good, but the subject matter not going anywhere suggests that overall, the sentiment isn't very positive. It's more on the negative side because the main issue with the subject matter could overshadow the acting. So perhaps a 1 for negative.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence has both positive and negative elements.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe text is: \"falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie 's reality and stifling its creator 's comic voice .\"\n\nFirst, I'll read through the sentence to get a general sense. It seems like it's talking about a movie and some issues with it. The words used are quite strong. Let me identify the key terms here.\n\n\"Falsehoods pile up\" - This suggests that there are many untruths or inaccuracies accumulating, which is a negative point. \"Undermining the movie's reality\" implies that these falsehoods weaken the believability of the film, making it less convincing. That\u2019s definitely negative.\n\nNext part: \"stifling its creator's comic voice.\" Stifle means to suppress or restrict something, in this case, the creator's ability to express humor. So, not only is the movie's reality weakened, but also the creator's intended comedic elements are being stifled. This seems like another negative aspect.\n\nPutting it together, the entire sentence is criticizing the movie for having too many falsehoods that ruin its realism and also hinder the creator's humor. Both aspects point towards a negative sentiment.\n\nNow, considering the scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive. The text is clearly negative because it points out flaws in the movie and criticizes how these flaws affect both the film's reality and its comedic elements.\n\nIs it just negative (1) or very negative (0)? Let me think. The use of \"pile up\" suggests a significant accumulation, which is quite strong. Also, both parts of the sentence are negative without any positive qualifiers. So, this seems more than just slightly negative; it's quite critical.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this sentiment as 0, very negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text strongly criticizes the movie for its falsehoods and lack of humor, indicating a very negative sentiment.\n\n0", 0, 1, 43.80768921598792], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me read the text again: \"Sadly, though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear, they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction.\"\n\nAlright, starting with the word \"sadly\" immediately sets a negative tone. That's a strong indicator that the sentiment isn't positive. Then it says that the actors have some initial good moments (\"throw off a spark or two\"), but they can't maintain that energy.\n\nThe phrase \"cold vacuum of a comedy\" suggests that the overall environment is unsatisfactory, which is another negative point. The fact that they couldn't generate enough heat to start a reaction implies that the outcome was unsuccessful or disappointing.\n\nPutting it all together, there's an initial mention of some positives with the actors, but the overall assessment seems critical and disappointed. It doesn't sound neutral because the author clearly expresses dissatisfaction. So I think this falls into the negative category.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, etc. Since there's a clear negative sentiment with some criticism about the actors not being able to generate enough heat, it doesn't seem extremely negative (like a 0). It's more of a mild negative but still definitely on the lower side.\n\nSo I think the sentiment here would be classified as 1, which is negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text starts with a negative word (\"sadly\") and criticizes the actors' inability to maintain energy, calling the comedy a \"cold vacuum.\" While there's a slight positive about the actors initially, the overall tone is negative. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 36.52811779399053], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The main point seems to be about South Korean filmmakers making action movies. The words used here are \"undemanding\" and \"alacrity\". \n\n\"Undemanding\" usually means something that doesn't require much effort or isn't challenging. So in this context, it might imply that the movies aren't too complex or perhaps lack depth. That could be a slightly negative point because it suggests they're not pushing boundaries or creating anything groundbreaking.\n\nThen there's \"alacrity\", which means quickness or eagerness. The sentence is saying South Korean filmmakers can make these undemanding action movies just as quickly as Hollywood does. This part sounds more positive, acknowledging their speed and efficiency in producing such films.\n\nPutting it together, the sentiment seems mixed but leans a bit negative because of \"undemanding\". However, the acknowledgment of their ability to match Hollywood's pace adds a positive aspect. \n\nI need to decide if this overall is neutral or slightly positive/negative. Since the focus is more on them being able to make these movies quickly without necessarily criticizing the quality too harshly, I might lean towards a neutral sentiment. So, I think the sentiment score should be 2.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence acknowledges South Korean filmmakers' ability to produce action movies efficiently but also suggests they may not be challenging or complex.

The fact that it mentions her mother still living there might evoke some emotional elements, possibly family connections or personal history, which can be neutral but in the context of a well-made film, could add depth positively.\n\nPutting this together, the text seems to praise the film for its skillful handling of Heidi's journey. There are no negative words here; instead, it highlights positive aspects like the quality of the filmmaking and the story being told. So, the sentiment is definitely leaning towards positive.\n\nNow, I need to assign a score from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).

The text is: \"the overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of `` 7th heaven . ''\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the sentence. The phrase \"overall feel\" suggests they're talking about their general impression or emotion after experiencing something, maybe a movie or TV show. Then it says it's \"not unlike watching a glorified episode of '7th heaven'.\" \n\nI know that \"glorified\" can have different connotations. It usually means to elevate or praise something excessively. But in this context, it might not be entirely positive because the comparison is to \"7th heaven,\" which I think was a TV show known for being quite saccharine and maybe overly sentimental.\n\nSo putting it together, the sentiment isn't negative per se but perhaps leaning towards neutral with a slight negative nuance. They're saying it's similar to an episode of \"7th heaven,\" which some people might find too sweet or unrealistic, hence not a very positive opinion. But since they didn't explicitly state it was bad, just comparable to another show that could be seen as overly sentimental, the sentiment isn't strongly negative either.\n\nSo considering all this, I think the sentiment is neutral but slightly on the lower side.

The sentence is: \"At best, Cletis Tuit might inspire a trip to the video store\u2014in search of a better movie experience.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part means. So, \"at best\" suggests that even in the most positive scenario, the outcome isn't great. It's like saying the best case is still not good enough. Then it says Cletis Tuit might inspire someone to go to the video store looking for a better movie experience. \n\nSo, the person is implying that watching Cletis Tuit isn't satisfying and that they'd rather find another movie elsewhere. That doesn't sound positive at all; in fact, it seems negative because they're seeking something better, which means the current option (Cletis Tuit) isn't up to par.\n\nBut wait, could there be any positivity? Maybe \"inspire a trip\" sounds like it's encouraging them to take action. However, the context is about looking for a better movie, so it's more about dissatisfaction with what they have. \n\nThe overall sentiment seems negative because the speaker is expressing that even the best scenario isn't good enough and they need to find something else. So, on the scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive), this should be a negative sentiment. But how negative?\n\nLooking at the options: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The statement isn't extremely harsh; it's more of a mild criticism or disappointment. So maybe it's not a 0 but closer to a 1 for negative.\n\nI think that makes sense because the user is pointing out dissatisfaction without using strong language. They're just stating that even at best, they'd rather find another movie. So, I'll go with 1 as the sentiment score.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative.

The sentence is \"fast , frantic and fun , but also soon forgotten.\" My task is to classify the sentiment on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 is neutral, 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the words used. The sentence starts with \"fast,\" which can be neutral or even slightly positive depending on context. Then it adds \"frantic\" and \"fun.\" Frantic usually has a negative connotation because it implies stress or chaos, while fun is clearly positive. So there's a mix here between some positive and some negative words.\n\nNext, the sentence continues with \"but also soon forgotten.\" The word \"forgotten\" can be seen as neutral but might lean slightly negative if the context suggests something was lost or not memorable. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if being forgotten is a good or bad thing here.\n\nPutting it all together: the first part has both positive and negative elements, and the latter part introduces another aspect that could be either neutral or negative. The overall sentiment doesn't lean heavily in one direction; there are positives and negatives balanced out. So I think this sentence isn't strongly positive or negative but rather sits somewhere in between.\n\nConsidering the scale, 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit here since there's a positive element (\"fun\"). 1 is negative, but again, with \"fun,\" it's not just negative. 2 is neutral, which might be a good fit because the positives and negatives balance out. But wait, maybe it's slightly more on the positive side? The first three words are strong: fast, frantic (negative), fun (positive). So two of them have direction, one negative, one positive.\n\nBut then \"soon forgotten\" could imply that despite being fast and fun, it wasn't memorable or lasting. That might lean towards a slight negative because it's not leaving a lasting impression. However, without more context, I can't be sure if the person is sad about forgetting it or if it's just an observation.\n\nGiven all this, I think the sentiment isn't strongly positive or negative but leans slightly towards neutral. So the best classification would be 2, neutral.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence mixes positive and negative elements without leaning strongly in either direction, resulting in a neutral sentiment.\n\n2", 2, 2, 51.03910568699939], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts with \"Personally,\" which might indicate a personal preference but doesn't necessarily carry a strong emotion on its own. Then it says, \"I'd rather watch them on the Animal Planet.\" The phrase \"I'd rather\" suggests that the speaker prefers watching something on Animal Planet over another option, perhaps implying they don't like where they're currently being shown or maybe just have a preference.\n\nBut wait, is this positive or negative? On one hand, expressing a preference could be neutral. It's stating a desire without strong emotion. On the other hand, \"I'd rather\" can sometimes imply dissatisfaction with the current situation. For example, if someone says they'd rather do something else, it might indicate that their current activity isn't enjoyable.\n\nHowever, in this context, the speaker is talking about watching something on Animal Planet. Since Animal Planet is a channel known for nature and animal documentaries, which are generally liked by people who enjoy such content, it could be seen as a positive preference. But again, it's just stating a preference without any explicitly positive or negative language.\n\nI don't see any strong adjectives here; the sentiment isn't explicitly stated as happy or unhappy. It's more about a choice. So maybe it's neutral? Or perhaps slightly positive because they're expressing a desire to watch something they probably enjoy, but I'm not entirely sure if that counts as positive.\n\nAlternatively, could it be negative? If the implication is that they don't like watching whatever \"them\" refers to where they currently are, then maybe there's an underlying dissatisfaction. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn sentiment analysis, sometimes preferences can lean towards neutral because they're not expressing a strong emotion but rather a choice. So I think the safest bet is to classify this as 2 (neutral) because while there's a preference stated, it doesn't strongly indicate positive or negative sentiment.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence expresses a personal preference without clear emotional intensity, leaning toward neutral.\n\nOutput: 2", 2, 0, 46.36794869200094], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence given is: \"The entire point of a shaggy dog story, of course, is that it goes nowhere, and this is classic nowheresville in every sense.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what's being said here. A shaggy dog story is a type of joke or narrative that starts off as if it's going somewhere but ends up with an absurdly simple or nonsensical punchline. The term itself often carries a negative connotation because the stories are known for being long-winded and not delivering anything meaningful.\n\nIn the text, the user mentions that the point is that it goes nowhere. That phrase \"goes nowhere\" clearly indicates a lack of progress or resolution, which is generally seen as negative. Then they describe something as \"classic nowheresville.\" Nowheresville is a term I'm not entirely familiar with, but given the context, it seems to be a place that's insignificant or unimpressive. Using \"nowheresville\" in this way likely reinforces the idea of something being unproductive or without value.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment here is negative because both phrases (\"goes nowhere\" and \"nowheresville\") express dissatisfaction or criticism about the shaggy dog story not delivering anything substantial. The use of \"classic\" might imply that this is a typical outcome, which could be seen as either a neutral observation or a further negative critique depending on context. However, in this case, it seems to emphasize the repetitive and disappointing nature.\n\nI should consider whether there's any positivity or neutrality here. But both parts of the sentence are pointing towards a lack of progress or value, so I don't see much room for positive sentiment. There's no indication of approval or satisfaction, just criticism about the story's directionlessness.\n\nSo, classifying this on the scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, I think it falls into the negative category. Given that both elements are clearly negative but not overly extreme (it's a common critique rather than something extremely harsh), maybe it's a 1 for negative.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment of the text is negative because it criticizes the shaggy dog story as going nowhere and describes it negatively as \"nowheresville.\" \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 46.48025529400911], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is: \"there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. The phrase starts with \"there is simply not enough,\" which immediately suggests a lack or insufficiency. The word \"simply\" emphasizes that it's a straightforward deficiency. \n\nNext, \"of interest onscreen\" indicates that whatever was shown wasn't engaging or captivating. So, the content didn't hold the viewer's attention.\n\nThen, the sentence mentions \"to sustain its seventy-minute running time.\" This part implies that the movie or show was too long for what it offered. It couldn't maintain the audience's engagement throughout the entire duration.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment is negative because the speaker is pointing out a deficiency in the content and criticizing the length as excessive given the lack of engaging elements. The use of \"not enough\" and the overall critical tone make this more than just neutral or slightly negative; it conveys dissatisfaction with both the content and its duration.\n\nSo, I think the sentiment here is negative. Considering the scale, 1 represents negative, so that should be the appropriate classification.\n</think>\n\nThe text criticizes the lack of engaging content and the excessive length, indicating a clear negative sentiment. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 31.05372735799756], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user has given me a sentence that I need to classify into one of five categories: 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), or 4 (very positive). \n\nThe text is about \"swimfan\" and compares it to \"fatal attraction.\" It says that both eventually go overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement, substituting a high school swimming pool for a bathtub. Hmm, so the main points here are comparing swimfan to fatal attraction in a negative way because they both have a dramatic ending that's described as \"loony\" and \"melodramatic.\"\n\nI need to break down each part. The term \"overboard\" suggests that something went too far, which is usually not good. \"Loony melodramatic denouement\" definitely sounds negative\u2014denouement refers to the resolution of a story, but adding \"loony\" and \"melodramatic\" implies it's excessive or unrealistic in a bad way. The substitution of a swimming pool for a bathtub also seems like an odd choice that might not make sense, which could be a criticism.\n\nPutting this together, the sentiment is negative because the reviewer is pointing out flaws in how the story ends, using terms that are critical. However, it's not extremely harsh; there aren't strong words like \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" So maybe it's on the lower end of negative but not the very bottom.\n\nSo I think this would be classified as 1 (negative). It's clearly not neutral because the language is critical. It's also not very positive, and while it's negative, it doesn't seem to reach the level of being extremely so.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses terms like \"overboard,\" \"loony,\" and \"melodramatic\" to criticize the story's ending, indicating a negative sentiment. However, the criticism isn't extreme.\n\n1", 1, 2, 39.912876316026086], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Then there's \"sulky teen drama.\" Sulky suggests someone being moody or sullen, which isn't negative per se but more of a neutral or slightly negative descriptor in the context of a genre. \n\nNext part: \"overcoming-obstacles sports-movie triumph.\" This sounds very positive. Overcoming obstacles usually implies success or achievement, and \"triumph\" is definitely a strong positive word.\n\nPutting it all together, the text uses several positive adjectives like deft and delightful, which are quite strong. The mention of sulky teen drama doesn't add much negativity because it's more about the genre than the sentiment. The overcoming obstacles part adds to the positivity. \n\nSo considering all these elements, the overall sentiment is positive. Now, I need to decide between 3 (positive) and 4 (very positive). Since there are multiple strong positive words but no superlatives beyond that, maybe it's a 3. However, \"delightful\" is quite strong, so perhaps it leans more towards 4.\n\nWait, the user example classified it as 3. Let me think again. The text combines two elements: teen drama which might not be very positive but the triumph part is. So overall, it's a mix but leaning positive. \"Delightful\" and \"triumph\" make it more on the higher side but maybe not extremely so. I think 3 is appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is positive due to words like \"delightful\" and \"triumph,\" but it's balanced by elements that aren't overly extreme. \n\n3", 3, 3, 44.32384882098995], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user has given a sentence that they want classified on a sentiment scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). \n\nLooking at the sentence: \"What's missing in Murder by Numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the words and their implications. The phrase \"what's missing\" suggests that something isn't there or is lacking, which generally carries a negative connotation. So right away, this sets a slightly critical tone.\n\nNext, they mention \"Murder by Numbers,\" which I assume is a movie or some form of media. The critique here is about the psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behavior being absent. \"Psychological grounding\" refers to the depth and realism in portraying characters' motivations and behaviors. If it's missing, that could mean the portrayal feels shallow or unrealistic.\n\nSo putting this together, the sentiment isn't extremely negative; it's more of a critique pointing out a deficiency. The person isn't completely trashing the work but is pointing out an area where it falls short. Therefore, this doesn't feel like a very positive statement, nor does it reach the level of very negative. It's somewhere in between.\n\nConsidering the scale, 0 is very negative, which would be something like \"This movie is terrible and should never have been made.\" A 1 might be more critical but not as harsh. Neutral (2) wouldn't apply here because there's a clear critique. So this seems to fall into a negative sentiment but not the most severe kind. Thus, I think it fits best as a 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence critiques the lack of psychological depth in a movie, indicating dissatisfaction without extreme negativity.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 0, 37.70413334999466], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence is: \"a well-rounded tribute to a man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the words used. \"Well-rounded\" usually has a positive connotation because it suggests completeness or thoroughness. So that's a good sign.\n\nNext, \"tribute\" typically implies respect or admiration towards someone, which is definitely positive. The phrase \"whose achievements\" again points to something praiseworthy. \n\nNow, looking at \"complexities,\" this could be neutral or have a slightly negative edge because complexities can sometimes imply difficulties or challenges. However, in the context of a tribute, it might just mean that the man had depth and wasn't one-dimensional.\n\nThe end part says \"reached far beyond the end zone.\" Since the end zone is a term from American football, I think this metaphor suggests that his influence went well beyond his professional field, which adds to the positive sentiment because it shows wide-reaching impact.\n\nPutting it all together: The use of positive words like \"tribute\" and \"achievements,\" along with the idea that his influence was far-reaching, makes me lean towards a positive sentiment. But I'm not sure if it's extremely positive or just moderately so. There's no overtly enthusiastic language, but it's clearly respectful and admiring.\n\nI think 3 is appropriate here because while there are positive elements, there's also some nuance with the word \"complexities,\" which might prevent it from being a very positive (4) sentiment.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 4, 31.05473181299749], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let's look at each part.\n\nThe phrase starts with \"in the real world,\" which sets a context of reality or expectation.

Credits like this might refer to minor roles or background appearances, indicating that the actor isn't getting significant parts despite their looks. \n\nPutting it together: The text is pointing out a contradiction where an attractive person (beautiful) lacks charm (uncharismatic), and because of that, they aren't landing substantial roles\u2014they're just playing generic characters like \"girl in bar #3.\" This seems to criticize the actor's inability to get better roles despite their looks. \n\nThe sentiment here is negative because it's highlighting a failure or limitation. The use of \"would have a resume loaded with\" suggests that this is expected, implying criticism rather than admiration.

It suggests something captures attention in an engaging way. Then \"dark thriller\" could be neutral depending on context, but here it seems to describe the genre without negative connotations. \n\nNext, \"keeps you hooked\" definitely indicates that the content is compelling and enjoyable\u2014another positive point. The phrase \"delicious pulpiness\" uses \"delicious,\" which is positive, even if \"pulpiness\" might sometimes be seen as over-the-top, but in this context, it's used approvingly. Lastly, \"lurid fiction\" could have a negative connotation because \"lurid\" often refers to something sensational or overly dramatic, but here it seems to be embraced as part of the thriller's appeal.\n\nPutting it all together, most descriptors are positive.

The text in question is: \"what saves this deeply affecting film from being merely a collection of wrenching cases is corcuera 's attention to detail.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each number represents. 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive.\n\nThe sentence starts by saying the film is \"deeply affecting,\" which sounds positive because it suggests an emotional impact. However, it also mentions that it's saved from being \"merely a collection of wrenching cases.\" The word \"wrenching\" has negative connotations, implying something painful or distressing. But then it says what saves it is the director's attention to detail, which is a positive attribute.\n\nSo the sentiment isn't entirely negative because there's an element that elevates the film. It's not overly positive either since it's pointing out a potential downside but then counters it with a positive aspect.

The description of him as a \"very sneaky butler\" adds character without any negative connotations, and \"excels in the art\" further emphasizes his skill.\n\nPutting this all together, the sentiment is definitely positive.

But wait, sometimes \"takes the cake\" can be used positively if the context is about being the best in a good way. However, given that the previous part is about bad actors, it's more likely they're saying Lil Bow Wow is the worst.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment here is quite negative.

The mention of Jackie Chan could have been a positive aspect, but in this case, it doesn't seem to add much because of how it's phrased.\n\nLooking at the structure, there are no strong adjectives indicating happiness or dissatisfaction. Words like \"amazing\" would push it towards positive, while words like \"terrible\" would make it negative. Here, we have nothing that stands out as particularly emotional.\n\nI might also think about possible implications. The speaker could be saying that despite having a famous actor, the movie isn't anything exceptional. This could imply a neutral or slightly negative sentiment because they're not excited about it but aren't outright criticizing it either.\n\nSo, considering all this, I don't see strong indicators of positivity or negativity.

Now, considering the options: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 is neutral, 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive.\n\nSince all the words are strong positives, I think it's more than just a little positive. \"Delightful\" especially feels like a stronger emotion.

In this case, even though each word is positive, without any superlatives beyond \"completely,\" I'm leaning towards it being positive but not extremely so.

The user has given a text: \"never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction.\" I need to classify its sentiment as 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), or 4 (very positive).\n\nFirst, I'll break down the text. The phrase starts with \"never again,\" which sounds negative because it implies not wanting to experience something again. However, after that, there are some positive words: \"pleasant,\" \"diverting,\" and \"modest.\" It also says it's \"definitely a step in the right direction,\" which is definitely positive.\n\nI need to weigh these elements. The initial part seems negative, but the rest of the sentence balances out with positive adjectives. The structure suggests that despite not being special, there are good qualities. So, overall, the sentiment leans more towards positive because the positives outweigh the negatives. But it's not extremely positive; it's a moderate positive.\n\nConsidering the scale, 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit here. 1 is negative, but again, since there are positive aspects, that might be too low. Neutral (2) could be possible if it were balanced without leaning either way, but I think the positives make it slightly more than neutral. So 3 seems appropriate as a positive sentiment. It's not extremely positive because of the initial \"never again,\" so it doesn't reach 4.\n\nI should also consider context. Sometimes phrases like \"never again\" can be used sarcastically or to emphasize how good something is despite past issues. Here, it seems more literal but followed by enough positives that it tips towards a positive sentiment.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 3, 36.81694991199765], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text provided is: \"caviezel embodies the transformation of his character completely.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what this sentence means. It seems to be talking about an actor named Caviezel and how he portrayed a character's transformation in a movie or play. The word \"embodies\" suggests that he fully represents or personifies something, which in this case is the transformation of his character.\n\nNow, looking at the words used: \"embodies completely.\" This seems positive because it implies that the actor successfully portrayed the changes required for his role. There's no negative language here; instead, it's a compliment on how well he performed.\n\nI should consider if there are any nuances I might be missing. The sentence doesn't express any dissatisfaction or criticism, which would lean towards a negative sentiment. It's more about acknowledging his success in the role.\n\nSo, putting this together, the sentiment is positive because it's a compliment on his performance. Since \"completely\" emphasizes the extent of his embodying the transformation, it adds to the positivity. Therefore, I think the correct classification would be a 3 or 4. But since it's not super exaggerated beyond just being thorough in his portrayal, maybe 3 is more accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed is positive as it praises the actor's performance. \n\n3", 3, 3, 28.39866348297801], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user provided a sentence: \"It all starts to smack of a Hallmark Hall of Fame, with a few four-letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television.\" And they want me to classify it as 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), or 4 (very positive).\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. The phrase \"smack of\" usually means resembling or being characteristic of something. In this case, it's comparing whatever is happening to a Hallmark Hall of Fame moment. Hallmark is known for its heartwarming, feel-good movies and shows, so that part could be positive.\n\nBut then there's the second part: \"with a few four-letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television.\" Four-letter words often refer to swear words or curse words. The fact that they're mentioned as being \"generally not heard\" suggests that their inclusion is unusual or unexpected, which could be negative because it adds a crude element to something that's otherwise clean and wholesome.\n\nSo putting this together, the sentence is mixing a positive aspect (Hallmark Hall of Fame) with a negative one (swearing). The overall sentiment isn't entirely positive because the use of four-letter words might detract from the feel-good vibe. It's not overly negative either because the comparison to Hallmark is still positive.\n\nI think this leans towards neutral but slightly on the positive side because the main reference is to something positive, even though there's a negative element added. So maybe it's a 2 (neutral) or perhaps a 3 (positive). But considering that the four-letter words are highlighted as being out of place, it might balance things out more towards neutral.\n\nWait, but the overall sentiment isn't strongly negative or positive. It's pointing out a mix\u2014something that is typically heartwarming with an unexpected coarse element. So maybe it's slightly negative because introducing swear words in a Hallmark context could be seen as lowering the quality or tone, making it less positive than intended.\n\nHmm, I'm torn between 2 and 1. But since the main comparison is to something positive (Hallmark), perhaps it's neutral with a slight positive tilt. Alternatively, considering the negative aspect of the swear words, maybe it tips just into the negative. \n\nI think the key here is that \"smack of Hallmark\" is a compliment, but adding the four-letter words takes away from that. So overall, it's not very positive because of the unexpected crudeness, but also not strongly negative since the main point is the similarity to Hallmark.\n\nIn the end, I'd probably rate this as neutral (2) because while there are elements pulling in both directions, neither sentiment is dominant enough to tip it into a clear positive or negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text combines a positive reference to Hallmark with a negative element of swear words.

So both adjectives are definitely negative.\n\nNow, Elizabeth Hurley is known as a beautiful actress, so calling her graceless and ugly is quite strong. The use of \"even\" emphasizes that it's surprising she seems this way, which adds more weight to the negativity.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment here is pretty harsh.

The user is talking about an imaginary Oscar category called \"best bad film.\" They imagine a situation where a movie they expected to be terrible wasn't as bad as anticipated. The reaction from people (\"guys\") would be competitive, duking it out with another entity, \"the queen of the damned,\" for that honor.\n\nNow, looking at sentiment: the user is expressing an idea about films being unexpectedly not awful, which could imply a slightly positive take because even though they expected something bad, the outcome wasn't as negative. The phrase \"wasn't\" suggests that it was better than anticipated.\n\nHowever, the context is about a category for bad films, so the sentiment isn't overly positive. It's more neutral with a slight leaning towards positive because the film wasn't as bad as expected. Also, the competitive aspect (\"duking it out\") might add a bit of humor or interest without being negative.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment seems neutral but with a slightly positive twist since the film wasn't as awful as anticipated.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 1, 29.49538330201176], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nI think the safest bet here is to consider it as neutral since it's a straightforward question.

The sentence is talking about people who get chills from movies that have big plot holes. It says they'll find plenty to shake and shiver about in \"The Ring.\"\n\nHmm, getting chills usually indicates a positive reaction, like being excited or scared in a thrilling way. So, if someone enjoys movies with giant plot holes, this could be seen as a compliment because it's suggesting the movie is thrilling enough despite its flaws.\n\nThe phrase \"plenty to shake and shiver about\" reinforces that idea\u2014it's saying there's lots to enjoy, specifically things that cause strong reactions like fear or excitement. So even though the text mentions plot holes, which are generally negative aspects of a movie, it's framed in a way that suggests these elements contribute positively to the experience.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment seems positive because it's highlighting enjoyable thrills from watching \"The Ring,\" even if there are flaws like plot holes.

So saying it's not that suggests something more serious or darker.\n\nNext, the characters are described as complex, which can be neutral but often implies depth rather than positivity. They have plenty of baggage\u2014this is negative, indicating issues or problems they carry. Then, \"tinged with tragic undertones\" clearly adds a sad or melancholic feel.\n\nPutting it all together, the text describes something serious and potentially depressing without any positive elements mentioned.

The phrase starts with \"with the exception of mccoist,\" which means that McCoist is an exception to whatever follows. Then it says the other players \"do n't have a clue.\" So, they're saying that most of the players are clueless or don't know what they're doing on the park.\n\nThe word \"clue\" here isn't positive; when someone doesn't have a clue, it usually means they're uninformed, confused, or lacking knowledge. In a sports context, this would imply poor performance or lack of understanding about their game. So, that part is definitely negative.\n\nBut then there's an exception: McCoist is not included in this criticism. That might make the sentiment slightly less negative because at least one person is doing well, but the rest are struggling. The overall tone still seems negative because it's pointing out the majority of players aren't performing well.\n\nI need to decide on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). Since the statement is critical of most players and only singles out McCoist as an exception, the sentiment isn't extremely negative. It's more moderately negative because while it points out a problem, there's some acknowledgment that not everyone is struggling.\n\nSo considering all this, I think the sentiment here is negative but not the most extreme.

That sounds really upsetting. So, when someone says something is as humorous as that, they're probably not saying it's funny at all. In fact, using such a sad or scary scenario suggests the opposite.\n\nI know that humor usually involves making people laugh or feel happy, but this comparison is quite grim. burying a pet alive is traumatic, so equating the movie's humor to that experience would imply the movie isn't humorous\u2014it might even be unpleasant or negative in its attempt at humor.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the sentiment here is definitely negative.

The example provided is \"even murphy's expert comic timing and famed charisma can't rescue this effort.\" \n\nFirst off, I need to analyze the sentiment here. The phrase starts with \"even murphy's expert...\" which suggests that Murphy has some notable skills\u2014comic timing and charisma are positives. But then it says those things \"can't rescue this effort,\" which implies that despite these strengths, the overall result is not good. \n\nSo, the sentiment seems negative because it's pointing out a failure even with positive attributes. Now, how negative is it? The word \"rescue\" here suggests a last-ditch attempt to save something that didn't work. So it's more than just a slight negative; it's a stronger negative.\n\nComparing to the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative. Since this isn't extremely harsh but still conveys failure, I think it's a 1. It's not the most extreme negative because there's an acknowledgment of Murphy's skills, but the overall outcome is unfavorable.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a negative sentiment as it implies that despite Murphy's strengths, the effort was unsuccessful.\n\n1", 1, 1, 28.305714724003337], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The product is Formula 51, which is making a promise\u2014it's supposed to offer something new, specifically a \"new kind of high.\" That sounds positive because promising something better or different usually has a favorable connotation.\n\nHowever, the second part says it \"delivers the same old bad trip.\" Here, \"bad trip\" clearly indicates dissatisfaction. The word \"bad\" is negative, and repeating \"same old\" suggests that the product hasn't improved; it's just more of the same issues as before.\n\nPutting this together: there's a promise (positive) but then a delivery of something negative. So the sentiment isn't extremely positive because of the letdown, nor is it extremely negative since the initial promise was good. It leans towards dissatisfaction but not an entirely bad experience.\n\nIn terms of intensity, \"bad trip\" is quite negative, so maybe that's a strong negative point. But considering the structure of the sentence, it starts with something promising and ends with a disappointment. So overall, it seems to express a negative sentiment because the product failed to meet expectations despite the promise.\n\nSo, on the scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, this seems closer to negative but not extremely so.

The text is: \"it 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors .\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. It has two parts connected by a comma. Let me look at each part separately.\n\nThe first part says, \"it's not the worst comedy of the year.\" So, they're comparing this comedy to others in the same year and stating it's not the absolute worst. That seems like a slightly positive statement because saying it's not the worst implies there are worse ones, but maybe it's better than some.\n\nThe second part is \"but it certainly won't win any honors.\" The word \"but\" here is important because it introduces a contrasting idea. So even though it's not the worst, it's still not good enough to be honored or recognized positively. This part sounds negative because winning honors would mean it's good, but they're saying it won't happen.\n\nPutting these together, the overall sentiment seems mixed. On one hand, it's not bad as the worst, which is a bit positive, but on the other hand, it's definitely not good enough to be honored, which is negative. So the positivity is tempered by the negativity in the second part.\n\nI'm thinking about how strong each of these sentiments is. The first part is a mild positive, while the second is a stronger negative because they're clearly stating it won't win any awards. So maybe the negative sentiment outweighs the positive.\n\nIn terms of intensity, \"not the worst\" isn't very strong; it's just an average or slightly above. But \"won't win any honors\" is more definitive and points to a lower quality that doesn't merit recognition. \n\nSo overall, I think the sentiment is leaning towards negative but not extremely so. It\u2019s not happy, but it's also not the most negative statement possible. Therefore, it might fall into category 1 (negative) because while there's a slight positive note, the main takeaway is the failure to be honored, which is more impactful.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that it's not the worst and just won't win honors, maybe it's neutral. But I think the emphasis on not winning any honors makes it negative.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is 1 (negative).

The phrase \"worthy of the price of a ticket\" suggests value for money, which is another positive sentiment.\n\nPutting it all together, each word contributes positively without any negative connotations. There are no words like \"bad,\" \"disappointing,\" or other negatives here. The overall tone seems to be very positive because it's recommending the entertainment as worth paying for and describes it as solid and spooky in a good way.\n\nI think this would rate higher on the positivity scale.

It starts by mentioning that the film is about explosions, death, and spies. These are typically intense or violent themes, which might be expected in an action movie. But then it says the film seems as safe as a children's film. So there's a contrast here between what's expected (intense content) and the actual experience (safe).\n\nThe word \"seems\" suggests that the expectation was for something more intense, but it turned out to be much tamer. Comparing it to a children's film implies that it's not as thrilling or violent as one might expect. That could mean the movie is either disappointing because it lacks intensity or refreshing for being family-friendly.\n\nBut I need to assess sentiment. The comparison to a children's film can have different connotations depending on context. If someone expected action and got something tame, they might feel let down, which would be negative. However, if they were looking for a safer option, this could be positive. \n\nIn the given sentence, there's no explicit positive or negative word like \"great\" or \"terrible.\" The sentiment is more neutral because it's stating an observation about the film being unexpectedly safe rather than expressing a strong opinion. So even though the expectation was high action, the delivery didn't meet that in terms of intensity.\n\nTherefore, I think the sentiment here isn't extremely negative or positive but leans slightly towards neutral because it's making a factual comparison without clear positivity or negativity.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 1, 36.51024214900099], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The words used are \"pathetic\" and \"exploitation,\" both of which have strong negative connotations. \"Pathetic\" means something is so bad it's almost laughable or pitiable, while \"exploitation\" in this context likely refers to taking advantage for profit, often in a way that's seen as unethical or manipulative.\n\nNext, the sentence says the film \"tries to seem sincere.\" That part suggests an attempt at being genuine, but the following phrase \"just seems worse for the effort\" indicates that this attempt didn't work and made things worse. So the sentiment here isn't just negative; it's exacerbated by the failure of the film's intentions.\n\nPutting it all together, the overall tone is very negative.

It mentions two actors, Diggs and Lathan, and states they're among the main reasons why \"Brown Sugar\" is a sweet and sexy film. The words \"sweet\" and \"sexy\" are both positive adjectives describing the movie.\n\nThe phrase \"chief reasons\" suggests that these actors played a significant role in making the film enjoyable. Using words like \"such\" and \"chief\" emphasizes their importance positively. There's no negative language here; instead, it's highlighting the positive aspects contributed by the actors.\n\nSo, breaking it down: \"sweet\" is clearly positive, and \"sexy\" can be seen as positive depending on context, but in this case, it's used to describe the film in a favorable way. The structure of the sentence is appreciative towards both the actors and the movie itself.\n\nTherefore, considering these factors, the sentiment expressed here is very positive. It's not just a neutral observation or a slightly positive one; it's quite enthusiastic about the contribution of the actors and the overall quality of the film.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 4, 26.077649257000303], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The main phrase is \"sitting through the last reel.\" The word \"reel\" here likely refers to a movie reel, so it's talking about watching a movie. The preposition \"through\" suggests that someone is enduring the experience rather than enjoying it. That makes me think of phrases like \"sitting through a meeting,\" which usually implies boredom or impatience.\n\nNext, there's \"(spoiler alert!)\". This part isn't directly expressing sentiment but serves as a warning about potential spoilers ahead. However, its presence might indicate that the speaker is discussing something they found impactful enough to warrant a spoiler warning, possibly negative if it was disappointing.\n\nPutting it together: \"sitting through\" suggests reluctance or dissatisfaction. The mention of \"spoiler alert\" implies that the content being discussed could be negative. So overall, the sentiment seems more on the negative side but not extremely so because there's no explicit strong negative words like \"hate\" or \"terrible.\" It leans towards negative but isn't overly harsh.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this as a 1, which is negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a negative sentiment due to the phrase \"sitting through,\" indicating reluctance.

However, in this sentence structure, since both \"overly long\" and \"worshipful\" are used to describe the bio-doc, I need to consider how they balance each other out. \n\nThe phrase seems to be pointing out two aspects: one negative (\"overly long\") and one positive (\"worshipful\"). The combination might lead to a mixed sentiment. However, given that \"overly\" is modifying \"long,\" which is generally seen as a drawback, while \"worshipful\" could be a compliment depending on context.\n\nBut in the context of a bio-doc, if it's overly long, that can be quite a negative point because documentaries are often appreciated for their concise storytelling. On the other hand, being worshipful might mean that it excessively idolizes its subject, which some viewers might find unbalanced or lacking critical analysis.\n\nConsidering both aspects, the overall sentiment leans more towards negative than positive. The use of \"overly\" and \"long\" have a stronger negative impact compared to the somewhat tempered positivity of \"worshipful.\" \n\nTherefore, I would rate this sentiment as 1 (negative), as it's not extremely negative but still conveys dissatisfaction with the documentary's length.\n</think>\n\nThe text describes the bio-doc as overly long and worshipful. While \"overly long\" has a negative connotation, indicating criticism for its length, \"worshipful\" suggests admiration or reverence. However, the use of \"overly\" could imply that it is excessive in a way that might not be entirely positive. Overall, the sentiment leans slightly negative due to the criticism of being too long.\n\n1", 1, 1, 51.24175284898956], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me read it again: \"With a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work, especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent, but as is, personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral.\"\n\nAlright, so breaking this down. The first part says that with some improvements like better editing or direction, the material could work. That sounds positive because it's suggesting potential for improvement. Then it compliments the actresses by saying they're \"more than competent,\" which is definitely a positive point.\n\nBut then the sentence shifts with \"but as is.\" This indicates a contrast or\u8f6c\u6298. It says that without those changes, \"Personal Velocity\" is idling in neutral. Idling in neutral suggests stagnation\u2014maybe not moving forward but also not going backward. So that's more of a neutral stance. \n\nPutting it all together: the text acknowledges strengths (competent actresses) and potential (with improvements), but as it stands now, it's neither positive nor negative\u2014it's just neutral. The use of \"could work\" implies possibility, but the current state is described as neutral.\n\nSo, considering the scale from 0 to 4 where 2 is neutral, I think this sentiment is right in the middle because while there are positive elements and some constructive feedback, the overall assessment without changes is neutral.\n</think>\n\nThe text acknowledges strengths and potential improvements but currently assesses the work as neither positive nor negative. \n\nAnswer: 2", 2, 1, 31.753607241989812], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

So that's a clue towards a negative sentiment. Then it says Kramer couldn't make a guest appearance. So someone was hoping for Kramer to appear but he didn't. The purpose of his appearance was to \"liven things up,\" which suggests they wanted more excitement or energy, implying that the current situation might be dull.\n\nSo putting it together: The speaker is expressing disappointment because Kramer wasn't able to come and add some life to the event or situation. But how negative is this sentiment? Is it very negative (0) or just a bit negative (1)?\n\n\"Too bad\" isn't extremely harsh; it's more of a mild expression of regret. There's no strong emotion like anger or sadness, just a sense that something enjoyable didn't happen. So maybe it's not the most extreme negative sentiment.\n\nOn the other hand, since there is an expression of disappointment and unfulfilled desire for something positive (livening things up), it does have a negative connotation. But is it strong enough to be a 1 or just barely negative?\n\nI think considering \"too bad\" as a phrase that's more on the softer side of negativity, so perhaps it's a 1 (negative) rather than 0 (very negative). It doesn't convey extreme frustration or anger, just a bit of disappointment.\n\nWait, but could it be neutral? The sentence is expressing a desire for something positive that didn't happen. So it's not entirely neutral because there's an expressed emotion of disappointment.

Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice the phrase \"even when it drags.\" The word \"drags\" usually has a negative connotation. It makes me think of something being slow or boring. So, at first glance, there might be some negativity here because dragging can imply that the pace isn't great.\n\nBut then the sentence continues: \"we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking.\" The word \"breathtaking\" is definitely positive\u2014it means something is so impressive it takes your breath away. So even though the first part has a negative aspect, the second part seems very positive.\n\nNow, I need to consider how these two parts balance out. The structure of the sentence uses \"even when,\" which often sets up contrast. It's like saying despite some negatives (dragging), there's something really good about it (the visual imagination). So even though the negative is mentioned first, the overall focus seems to be on the positive aspect.\n\nI also think about how forced reflection might tie into this. Forced to reflect suggests that maybe the experience isn't always smooth, but when you do take the time to think about it, there's a lot of value in the visual elements. So, even though the pacing is an issue, the visuals are so good that they make up for it.\n\nConsidering all this, I don't think the sentiment is neutral because the positive aspect (\"breathtaking\") seems stronger and more impactful than the negative (\"drags\"). However, it's not extremely positive either because there's still a mention of something not being ideal. So maybe it falls somewhere in between\u2014positive but not very positive.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The sentiment scale is from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). Neutral is 2. Since the positives are highlighted more, I'm leaning towards a higher number than neutral. But since there's still a negative point mentioned, maybe it's just above neutral but not extremely high.\n\nHmm, another angle: sometimes in reviews or opinions, even if something has flaws, the strong positive elements can make the overall sentiment positive. So even though \"drags\" is a negative, the \"breathtaking visual imagination\" could tip the balance towards positivity without being overly enthusiastic.\n\nSo putting it all together, I think the sentiment leans more positive but isn't extremely so. Therefore, probably a 3 for positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text mentions both a negative aspect (\"drags\") and a strong positive aspect (\"breathtaking\"). The focus on the positive visual imagination suggests an overall positive sentiment that's not extreme.\n\n3", 3, 3, 55.25749833800364], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

That's inherently a sad and difficult situation, so that leans toward negative emotions. However, the use of \"depiction\" as moving might add some positivity because it shows empathy or emotional impact without necessarily being joyful.\n\nPutting it all together: The topic is sad (negative), but described in a way that's emotionally engaging (\"moving\"), which could be seen as positive in terms of storytelling. The word \"weighty\" adds to the gravity, making it more serious but not necessarily negative. So overall, it seems like the sentiment isn't extremely negative because it's about healing and is portrayed movingly.\n\nI think the sentiment here is probably neutral or slightly positive. Since the family is attempting to heal, there's a sense of hope, even though the subject matter is sad. The use of \"moving\" suggests that the portrayal is effective and perhaps touching in a way that's appreciated.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 3, 32.09775959100807], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Jostling might mean moving around or bumping into things, which could suggest action or perhaps a bit of chaos, but not necessarily negative. It depends on context. Here, since it's part of a comedy description, jostling probably adds to the dynamic and energetic feel.\n\nThen there's \"to the rhythms of life.\" Rhythms usually have a positive association; they can mean flow, pattern, or structure in life. So combining that with the previous words, it seems like the sentence is talking about a comedy that has energy, movement, and aligns well with the natural flow of life.\n\nPutting it all together: The text describes a comedy that's lively and energetic, connecting with the rhythms of life. There are no negative words here; everything points towards positive descriptors. It feels uplifting and vibrant, which would lean more towards a very positive sentiment.\n\nSo, considering the scale, 4 is for very positive.

The subject here is Dylan Kidd, who is a first-time writer-director. The sentence mentions two positive aspects: having a good ear for dialogue and characters sounding real. Both of these are compliments. \"Good ear for dialogue\" suggests that the dialogues are well-written, which is a positive trait in filmmaking or writing. Similarly, characters sounding like real people means they're relatable and believable, another positive aspect.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. The adjectives used are positive: \"good\" and describing something as \"real.\" There's no comparison or sarcasm that I can detect. It seems straightforward praise for Dylan Kidd's work.\n\nSo considering the scale from 0 to 4, this sentiment is clearly positive. Now, how positive? Is it just a simple positive (3) or very positive (4)? The sentence uses \"good\" which isn't extremely strong, but \"real people\" adds depth, making the compliment more substantial. It's not overly effusive, so maybe it's on the higher end of positive but not the absolute top.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

That doesn't sound fun.\n\nSo the comparison is making me think of something that's not engaging or enjoyable. The fact that there's nothing to drink could symbolize a lack of excitement or worthwhile content in the series. Putting it all together, the sentiment seems pretty negative because they're highlighting how disappointing and uneventful the show is.\n\nI should rate this as negative, so either 0 or 1.

The sentence starts with \"wimps out,\" which generally has a negative connotation. It implies that someone didn't take a bold action or was cowardly. In this context, it's about a movie choosing a PG-13 rating instead of something more graphic. \n\nThe phrase \"so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen\" suggests that there's less intense violence because of the rating. The word \"muted\" when talking about sexuality also indicates that it's toned down. So overall, the text is pointing out that by choosing a PG-13 rating, certain elements are lessened or kept off-screen.\n\nI need to determine if this sentiment is negative, positive, or neutral. Using \"wimps out\" is definitely a criticism, so that's negative. The rest of the sentence explains why it's criticized\u2014because of limiting graphic content and muting sexuality. However, it doesn't express extreme anger or frustration, just a criticism about the decision.\n\nSo considering the options: 0 is very negative, which might be too strong here because while it's critical, it's not overly harsh.

The text is: \"soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. It mentions Soderbergh, which I believe refers to director Steven Soderbergh. He's known for his work in films like \"Ocean's Eleven\" and others. The phrase \"skims the fat\" caught my attention. I think \"skim the fat\" is an idiom that means removing unnecessary or excess parts of something, often implying improvement by simplifying or making more efficient.\n\nIn this context, saying Soderbergh skims the fat from a 1972 film suggests that he's made some changes to improve it. Maybe he reworked or updated the original film. The use of \"skims the fat\" could be positive because it implies refining and enhancing rather than just copying.\n\nHowever, I should consider if this phrase might have a negative connotation in some contexts. For example, skimming the fat can sometimes mean taking shortcuts or removing important elements, which would not be good. But given that Soderbergh is known for his directorial skills, it's more likely that he made the film better by refining it.\n\nSo putting this together, the sentiment seems positive because it suggests improvement through editing or reworking. Therefore, I think the sentiment score should be 3 (positive).\n</think>\n\nThe text positively implies that Soderbergh improved upon a 1972 film by skimming the fat, which means refining and enhancing it.\n\nAnswer: 3", 3, 3, 34.90629893000005], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the words used: \"small,\" \"gem,\" and \"belgium.\" I know that \"gem\" is a term of endearment or praise, often used to describe something precious or valuable. So right there, it seems positive. The word \"small\" might not be inherently negative or positive\u2014it depends on context. In this case, it's modifying \"gem,\" so it doesn't seem like it's adding any negativity. Instead, it might just emphasize that despite being small, it's still a gem.\n\nPutting it together, the phrase is saying something positive about Belgium. It's referring to Belgium as a \"small gem,\" which probably means they're highlighting its charm or value in a compact form. So this feels like a compliment towards Belgium.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment scale: 0 is very negative, so that doesn't fit here at all. Negative (1) also isn't appropriate since there's no negativity in the text. Neutral (2) could be considered if it were just stating facts without emotion, but the use of \"gem\" adds a positive connotation. Positive (3) seems right because it's clearly a compliment.

The sentence is: \"the locale ... remains far more interesting than the story at hand.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence. It seems to be comparing two things: the locale and the story. The word \"remains\" suggests that the locale has consistently been something of interest. The phrase \"far more interesting\" indicates a strong preference towards the locale over the story.\n\nSo, what does this comparison imply about the sentiment? Well, if the locale is more interesting than the story, it means the speaker finds the story less engaging or perhaps even uninteresting. That would lean towards a negative sentiment regarding the story itself.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, and 1 is just negative. The sentence doesn't use strong negative language; instead, it's a comparison that subtly criticizes the story. So, it's not extremely negative but still points out that one aspect (the locale) is better than another (the story). \n\nI don't think it's neutral because there's an explicit comparison showing preference, which implies judgment. It's also not positive because it's highlighting a deficiency in the story. Therefore, the sentiment is negative but not extremely so.\n\nSo, on the scale provided, I would classify this as 1 (negative).\n</think>\n\nThe sentence compares the locale favorably to the story, indicating that the story lacks interest.

The user provided an example where they took the sentence \"The acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the Walmart checkout line.\" and classified it as 1, which means negative.\n\nLet me break down why that might be the case. First, I'll look for positive or negative words. The phrase starts with \"the acting is fine,\" so \"fine\" is somewhat neutral but maybe slightly positive. Then there's a contrast with \"but,\" indicating a shift in sentiment. The next part says the script isn't interesting\u2014it compares it to conversations at Walmart checkout lines, which are typically mundane and boring.\n\nSo the overall sentiment here seems negative because while one aspect (acting) is okay, another crucial element (script) is criticized harshly. That makes the overall feeling lean more towards negative rather than neutral or positive.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, up to 4 being very positive. The example got a 1 because it's not extremely negative but still points out a significant flaw in the script that overshadows the acting.\n\nI should apply similar logic when analyzing other texts. Look for balancing elements (like \"but\"), identify key terms indicating sentiment, and determine if the overall tone is more negative or positive. Also, context matters; even if some parts are neutral or slightly positive, a strong negative critique can lower the sentiment score.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 1, 31.229969796026126], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts with \"nearly all,\" which suggests a comprehensive issue. Then, \"fundamentals you take for granted\" implies that these are basic elements that are usually expected in films. The word \"mishandled\" is negative; it means something was handled poorly or incorrectly.\n\nPutting it together, the speaker is pointing out that almost every fundamental aspect of filmmaking that's typically done well in most movies isn't being handled properly here. This indicates a significant problem with the film, which would likely make the sentiment very negative. \n\nI don't see any positive or neutral words here. The focus is entirely on what's wrong with the film. So, considering the options, 0 represents very negative, which fits because it's a strong criticism of almost all aspects.

The text is: \"believes so fervently in humanity that it feels almost anachronistic , and it is too cute by half .\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the sentence. The phrase \"believes so fervently in humanity\" shows strong belief, which is positive. The word \"fervently\" indicates intensity, adding to the positivity.\n\nNext part: \"feels almost anachronistic.\" Anachronistic means something that's out of place in time. Here, it might suggest that the belief seems outdated or old-fashioned, but depending on context, this could be seen as a positive trait\u2014maybe endearing or timeless.\n\nThen, \"and it is too cute by half.\" The word \"cute\" is clearly positive, and \"too...by half\" often means something is excessively so. So \"too cute\" would imply a very positive sentiment here.\n\nPutting it all together: The text expresses strong belief in humanity (positive), perhaps being seen as timeless or endearing (slightly more positive), and extremely cute (very positive). There's no negative language here; everything points to positive sentiments.\n\nSo, considering the scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, this should be a high score.

The main subject here is Carvey, and it's talking about him needing a disguise\u2014specifically a paper bag\u2014to hide from people. Why? Because he's described as someone who \"bilked unsuspecting moviegoers.\" \n\n\"Bilked\" means to cheat or defraud someone. So the text is accusing Carvey of cheating moviegoers. That sounds pretty negative towards him. The suggestion that he needs a disguise implies that people are upset with him, so when he goes out in public, wearing a paper bag would help him avoid recognition and confrontation.\n\nThe overall tone here is clearly critical and negative. There's no positive language; instead, it's expressing anger or disappointment at Carvey's actions. The use of words like \"bilking\" and the idea of needing a disguise to hide from the public shows that his reputation is damaged.\n\nI don't see any neutral elements here. It's not just a mild criticism but a strong condemnation. So considering the scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, this should be towards the lower end.\n\nWait, let me think again\u2014if it's about someone being deceptive and cheating people, that's definitely a negative sentiment. The suggestion of hiding with a paper bag adds to the embarrassment or shame he might feel, reinforcing the negativity.\n\nSo I don't see any positivity here at all.

The example given was a recommendation, so it's positive. But how do I approach this systematically?\n\nI think I should start by looking at the words used and their connotations. Words like \"seriously\" can indicate emphasis but aren't inherently positive or negative. However, in context, when someone says \"seriously, rent the Disney version,\" they're likely expressing enthusiasm or a strong recommendation.\n\nNext, considering punctuation. The example has an exclamation mark, which often denotes excitement or strong feelings. But if there were negative words with such punctuation, it might indicate something else.\n\nI also need to consider any emotional indicators. Words like \"rent\" in this context are neutral on their own but combined with \"seriously,\" they lean towards a positive recommendation.\n\nAnother thing is the subject matter. Disney versions of movies or shows often have a positive connotation for many people, so recommending it could be seen as a positive sentiment.\n\nI should also think about negations. If there were words like \"not\" or \"don't,\" that would indicate negativity, but in this case, there aren't any.\n\nAdditionally, considering the context helps. Without knowing more, I have to assume the recommendation is genuine and positive unless indicated otherwise.\n\nSo putting it all together: emphasis on the action (renting), a recommendation, and the implication of enjoyment leads me to classify this as 3 - positive.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is positive because it includes an enthusiastic recommendation.

This way, the parent can watch it later when the kids are older.\n\nSo, what does this convey? It seems reassuring and positive because they're saying that even though you might miss out now, you'll have a record of it for later. The use of \"don't worry\" suggests comfort or ease about the situation. There's no negative language here; instead, it's about preserving memories which is usually seen as a good thing.\n\nI don't see any words with negative connotations. It's more about looking forward and being positive about having these videos for the future. So, the sentiment is definitely positive but not extremely so.

It mentions a \"battle,\" which typically has a negative connotation because battles imply conflict or struggle. Then there are two entities involved: \"bug-eye theatre\" and \"dead-eye matinee.\" Both have unusual names that might carry their own implications.\n\nLooking at the words used in the names, \"bug-eye\" could refer to something comical or perhaps of low quality since it's not a standard term. Similarly, \"dead-eye\" suggests something lifeless or uninteresting. These terms don't seem positive; they might be criticizing the theatres involved.\n\nThe overall structure talks about a competition or conflict between these two entities. Without more context, I can infer that this is describing a clash of some sort, which isn't neutral. Given that both names have negative-sounding adjectives, it leans towards a negative sentiment rather than positive.\n\nSo considering all that, the sentiment isn't extremely negative (which would be 0), but it's still not positive or neutral.

The word \"passive\" could be neutral or slightly negative depending on context, but here it's just describing the method. Then it says the technique \"eventually begins to yield some interesting results.\" \"Yield\" and \"interesting results\" are positive terms. So after an initial irritation, there's a positive outcome.\n\nPutting it all together: The first part is strongly negative, but the latter part turns into something positive. However, the overall sentiment isn't extremely positive because it started with a negative experience. It's more of a mixed feeling that leans towards positive in the end.\n\nOn the scale from 0 to 4, considering the initial irritation and then the positive results, I think this would be a 3, which is positive but not extremely so.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 2, 29.444293499022024], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The word \"inspiring\" suggests something positive because it implies that watching these people gives motivation or a sense of admiration. Then there's \"pure joy,\" which is definitely a strong positive emotion. Words like \"joy\" are very uplifting and convey happiness.\n\nPutting these together, both descriptors are positive. There's no negative language here; instead, the focus is on the enjoyable and motivating experience of watching these eccentrics. Eccentric can sometimes have a neutral or even slightly negative connotation if it implies being odd or unusual, but in this context, it's paired with positive emotions like inspiration and joy.\n\nSo, considering that both adjectives are strongly positive, the sentiment should be on the higher end. The scale goes up to 4 as very positive. Since \"inspiring\" is positive and \"pure joy\" is extremely positive, I think a 3 or 4 would make sense. However, since it's two strong positives but not hyperbole beyond just being very positive, I might lean towards 3.\n\nWait, maybe even 4 because the combination of both words adds up to a very positive sentiment. \"Pure joy\" is quite intense, so perhaps 4 is more accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a strongly positive sentiment with words like \"inspiring\" and \"pure joy.\" \n\nAnswer: 4", 4, 4, 34.09623100500903], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

However, it goes on to say that the film \"reflects the worst of their shallow styles.\" The words \"worst\" and \"shallow\" are strong negative adjectives here. \n\nNext, the text describes the film as \"wildly overproduced,\" which suggests excessive production without necessary value. Then, it says it's \"inadequately motivated every step of the way\"\u2014this indicates that the motivations were insufficient or lacking, another negative point.\n\nLastly, it mentions being demographically targeted to please everyone and no one. This implies a failure in targeting a specific audience, which could mean it didn't appeal effectively to any group, hence not achieving its intended impact. \n\nPutting this all together: The sentiment is clearly negative.

Let me read the text again: \"it's the cute frissons of discovery and humor between Chaplin and Kidman that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking, but humming.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the words. \"Cute\" is definitely a positive word, showing something endearing or pleasant. \"Frissons\" refers to a tingling feeling, often associated with excitement or pleasure, so that's positive too. Then there's \"discovery,\" which suggests something new and interesting, another positive aspect.\n\nNext, the text mentions \"humor between Chaplin and Kidman.\" Both are known for their comedic roles, so this adds a layer of positivity. The phrase \"keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking, but humming\" uses a metaphor where the clock represents something orderly or consistent. \"Ticking\" is normal, but \"humming\" implies it's running smoothly and perhaps with some extra energy or enjoyment.\n\nPutting it all together: The text talks about positive elements like cuteness, excitement from discovery, humor, and a smooth operation (the clock analogy). There are no negative words here; everything points towards a favorable view. So, the sentiment is quite positive but not extremely so because it's more descriptive than overly enthusiastic.\n\nI think 3 would be appropriate since it's clearly positive without being the highest level of positivity.

That comparison might seem odd at first, but let's see what it implies. The description starts with \"familiar,\" which isn't inherently positive or negative\u2014it just states something is recognizable. Then \"fairly uneventful\"\u2014this could lean slightly negative because \"uneventful\" often means lacking excitement, which some people find boring.\n\nNext part: \"boasting no real surprises.\" Again, this suggests that the movie doesn't have unexpected twists or shocks, which might be seen as a downside if someone was expecting more originality or suspense. So far, these descriptors aren't negative but could be perceived as slightly underwhelming.\n\nHowever, the sentence then flips with \"but still quite tasty and inviting all the same.\" This is clearly positive language\u2014\"tasty\" and \"inviting\" are strong positive adjectives. The use of \"still\" emphasizes that despite being familiar and uneventful, the movie remains enjoyable. \n\nPutting it all together: While there are elements that might be considered neutral or slightly negative (familiarity, lack of surprises), the overall tone leans towards positive because the latter part highlights enjoyment and appeal. It's not overly enthusiastic but still conveys a favorable view.\n\nSo considering the options, 0 is very negative\u2014definitely not the case here. 1 is negative; while there are some unimpressive aspects, they're balanced by positive descriptors. Neutral (2) could be a possibility because it's a mix, but the emphasis on being \"tasty and inviting\" tips it more towards positive without being overly effusive. 3 seems appropriate as it's positive but not extremely so. 4 is very positive, which might overstate the sentiment since there are some caveats mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment here is positive but not extremely, so I'd classify it as a 3.\n</think>\n\nThe text describes Clint Eastwood's Blood Work with a balanced view, noting its familiarity and lack of surprises but ultimately finding it enjoyable.

Without more context, I have to work with what's given. \n\nThe words \"spy\" and \"vs.\" stand out. \"Spy\" can refer to espionage activities, which often involve deceit or secretive actions. That could lean towards negative connotations because spying usually isn't seen in a positive light\u2014it involves betrayal or invasion of privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, \"vs.\" is an abbreviation for \"versus,\" which means against or comparing two things. So, \"spy vs .\" might be setting up a comparison or conflict between spies and something else. If it's just the beginning of a sentence, like \"Spy vs. what?\", the sentiment isn't clear yet. It depends on what comes after \"vs.\"\n\nBut since there's no additional context provided, I have to make an assumption based solely on the given words. Without knowing what the spy is against or who/what they are comparing with, it's hard to gauge the sentiment definitively.\n\nConsidering that \"spy\" can be associated with negative actions like espionage, but without further information about the situation or the other party in the comparison, I might lean towards a neutral stance. It's not clearly positive or negative; it just presents an action (spying) versus something else, which isn't specified here.\n\nI should also consider that sometimes \"spy\" can be part of a title, like a game or movie, where the context could vary widely. Without knowing if this is from a review, description, or another source, I can't determine the sentiment accurately beyond neutral.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The phrase doesn't express strong positive or negative emotions on its own.

However, in this context, it's paired with \"96 minutes,\" so maybe it's just indicating the movie's runtime without a strong sentiment.\n  \n- \"Mediocre special effects\": That's clearly negative because mediocre implies they're not great and somewhat disappointing.\n\n- \"Hoary dialogue\": Hoary means old or stale. So this is another negative point about the script.\n\n- \"Fluxing accents\": Fluxing might mean changing or inconsistent, which can be annoying for viewers, so that's negative too.\n\n- The part with \"silly-looking morlocks\" is definitely negative. It suggests that these creatures look ridiculous, which would take away from the movie's believability and enjoyment.\n\nPutting it all together, most of the descriptors are negative. Even though \"zippy\" could be a bit positive, it's outweighed by the other criticisms. The mention of \"mediocre,\" \"hoary,\" and \"silly-looking\" indicates that the sentiment is leaning towards very negative.\n\nSo, considering the scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, I think this text deserves a 0.\n</think>\n\nThe text describes several negative aspects: mediocre special effects, hoary dialogue, fluxing accents, and silly-looking Morlocks.

The first phrase is \"schmaltzy\" which usually means overly sentimental in a cloying way. That's not very positive. Then \"by-the-numbers\" suggests it's formulaic or lacking originality\u2014another negative point. So the romantic comedy aspect isn't being praised here.\n\nNext, \"shallow rumination on the emptiness of success\"\u2014so this is talking about reflecting on the meaninglessness of success but in a shallow way. That indicates that while the topic might be deep, the execution isn't, which again seems negative or at least not positive.\n\nFinally, it ends with \"entirely soulless.\" Soulless means lacking depth or emotional impact, so that's definitely a strong negative sentiment.\n\nPutting it all together: The text criticizes the romantic comedy as being formulaic and overly sentimental, discusses a shallow exploration of success, and calls the whole thing soulless. All these points are negative.\n\nNow, considering the scale from 0 to 4: 0 is very negative, which seems to fit because multiple strong negative adjectives are used. But I should check if there's any positive aspect here that might make it less than 0. The text doesn't mention anything good about the work, so it's entirely negative.\n\nWait, but sometimes even in negative reviews, people might have some minor positives. Here, though, all descriptors are negative\u2014schmaltzy, by-the-numbers, shallow, soulless. No positive words at all. So this should be a strong negative sentiment.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment is very negative, so I'd classify it as 0.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses several strongly negative adjectives to describe the romantic comedy and its themes, with no positive aspects mentioned. \n\nAnswer: 0", 0, 0, 47.37216344699846], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts by mentioning that this is Spielberg's first attempt at film noir. That's neutral information\u2014it just states a fact about his work.\n\nNext, it says he \"presents a fascinating but flawed look.\" The word \"fascinating\" has a positive connotation, suggesting something interesting and engaging. However, the use of \"but\" indicates a contrast or a downside, which is where \"flawed\" comes in. Flawed means there are imperfections or shortcomings.\n\nSo, the sentiment seems mixed here. On one hand, it's acknowledging something positive about the film (\"fascinating\"), but on the other hand, it points out that it's not without its issues (\"flawed\"). The use of \"but\" suggests that while there are good aspects, the flaws might be significant enough to temper the overall positive impression.\n\nNow, considering how this would rate. Since it's mixed with both positive and negative elements, but perhaps leaning a bit more towards the positive because \"fascinating\" is a strong word and maybe outweighs the \"flawed.\" However, I'm not sure if it's enough to go beyond neutral.\n\nAlternatively, some might interpret that the positives are noted first, which could make the overall sentiment slightly positive. But since there's a clear mention of flaws, it doesn't feel very positive either.\n\nSo, maybe the sentiment is neutral (2) because it has both positive and negative elements balancing each other out. Or perhaps just leaning towards positive with some caveats, making it 3? I'm a bit torn here.\n\nAnother angle: in film reviews, when someone says something is fascinating but flawed, they might be giving it a middle rating, not extremely high or low. So, that could mean neutral.\n\nI think the safest choice here is to go with neutral (2) because while there are positive and negative aspects mentioned, neither seems to dominate strongly enough to push it into positive or negative territory.\n</think>\n\nThe text presents both positive (\"fascinating\") and negative (\"flawed\") elements.

The phrase \"at its best\" immediately stands out as positive. It suggests that whatever is being discussed (probably a movie) is at the top of its game. Then, \"grand-scale moviemaking\" definitely sounds complimentary\u2014it implies something epic and well-produced.\n\nNext part: \"for a larger-than-life figure.\" This describes someone who's beyond ordinary, perhaps charismatic or influential. Positive again. The artist mentioned has been given \"mythic status,\" which means they're legendary or highly revered in today's culture. That's another positive indicator.\n\nPutting it all together, each phrase contributes to an overall favorable sentiment. There's no negative language here; everything points towards praise and admiration.

It could just be a casual interjection without much sentiment. If I have to assign a number based on this alone, I might lean towards neutral because it doesn't clearly show positive or strong negative feelings.\n\nWait, but sometimes \"eh\" can carry a slightly negative connotation, like when someone is dismissive or not really interested. So maybe it's just slightly negative. But then again, in other contexts, it could be neutral or even used in a friendly way without any negativity.\n\nSince the user didn't provide more context, I think the safest bet is to consider \"eh\" as neutral because without knowing the speaker's intent or situation, it's hard to assign a definitive sentiment.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 2, 32.75025994400494], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text provided is: \"a new film from bill plympton , the animation master , is always welcome .\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what sentiment classification entails. It's about determining whether a piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral emotion. In this case, since it's specifically about Bill Plympton, an animator known for his work, the context is likely related to his films.\n\nLooking at the sentence, \"a new film from bill plympton , the animation master , is always welcome .\" The key words here are \"new film,\" \"animation master,\" and \"always welcome.\" The phrase \"is always welcome\" suggests a positive expectation or reception. It implies that whenever Bill Plympton releases a new film, people are happy about it because of his reputation as an animation master.\n\nI should consider the sentiment conveyed by these words. \"Welcome\" is a positive term, indicating approval or acceptance. Since Plympton is referred to as the \"animation master,\" this title adds weight to the positivity, suggesting respect and admiration for his work. Therefore, the overall tone of the sentence is favorable towards Bill Plympton's new film.\n\nNow, mapping this to the given scale: 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit here. 1 is negative, also not applicable. Neutral would be a 2, but the text shows a positive sentiment. So between 3 (positive) and 4 (very positive). The sentence uses \"always welcome,\" which indicates strong positivity. Therefore, it's more than just positive; it's very positive.\n\nWait, but sometimes people might use hyperbole, so I should be cautious. However, given that Bill Plympton is a respected animator, the statement seems genuine and not exaggerated in this context. So, it's safe to classify this as very positive.\n\nI also need to make sure there are no negative undertones here. There's nothing indicating dissatisfaction or criticism; instead, it's all praise for his work.

The text is: \"feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker 's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women.\"\n\nFirst, I'll read through the sentence carefully. It starts by saying it \"feels like nothing quite so much,\" which is a bit abstract. Then it describes a middle-aged moviemaker trying to surround himself with beautiful, half-naked women. \n\nI should analyze the connotations here. The phrase \"surround himself with\" could imply that the moviemaker is focused on appearance or perhaps objectifying these women. Using terms like \"beautiful\" and \"half-naked\" might be seen as sexually suggestive or even derogatory, depending on context.\n\nIs this a positive portrayal? It doesn't seem so. The description feels more like it's critiquing the moviemaker's behavior or attitude. Maybe pointing out that he's fixated on these women in an objectifying way. That would lean towards a negative sentiment.\n\nI also notice the structure of the sentence: \"feels like nothing quite so much as...\" This could be expressing dissatisfaction or disillusionment, perhaps indicating that this situation doesn't bring real satisfaction but rather something superficial or unsatisfying.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment seems negative. The moviemaker's behavior is being portrayed in a way that's not complimentary\u2014it might be suggesting vanity or objectification, which are generally viewed negatively. Therefore, I would classify this as 1 (negative).\n</think>\n\nThe text critiques a moviemaker's fixation on surrounding himself with beautiful, half-naked women, implying objectification and dissatisfaction.

The first part is a bit negative because it's pointing out that some might find the concepts confusing or not credible. Using words like \"mumbo-jumbo\" definitely has a negative connotation. But then the second part is positive, highlighting common sense and clarity. So there's a mix here.\n\nI need to decide if the overall sentiment leans more positive, neutral, or maybe still negative despite the positive elements. The phrase \"broad streaks of common sense\" suggests that even though some parts might be off-putting, the underlying message is clear and sensible. The word \"unimpeachable\" emphasizes how undeniable this clarity is.\n\nSo putting it together: while there's a criticism in the beginning, the latter part is quite strong in its positive assertion.

It could be \"reading my lips\" if we're talking about the act of reading, but I'm not entirely sure. Regardless, the main structure seems to focus on the pleasure aspect.\n\nThe metaphor used here compares the experience to seeing perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string. Pearls are often associated with beauty and value, so describing them as \"perfect\" adds to that positive imagery. The action of them clicking together suggests a smooth, harmonious process, which is another positive connotation.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence uses words like \"pleasure,\" \"perfect,\" and \"black pearls,\" all of which contribute to a very positive sentiment.

Banal means something is boring or unoriginal, so that's another negative point.\n\nNext, the user talks about convenient and hole-ridden plotting. Hole-ridden implies the plot has a lot of flaws or gaps, which again is negative. Superficial characters are mentioned too, meaning they lack depth, which isn't good for a movie review.\n\nLastly, there's a dull and unimaginative car chase.

In this context, it's a bit negative because it suggests that the movie isn't bringing anything new; it feels repetitive or familiar in a way that might be disappointing.\n\nNext part: \"the grandeur of the best next generation episodes is lacking.\" This directly states that the current content (probably referring to Star Trek II) doesn't have the same grandeur as the Next Generation episodes. So, they're comparing it unfavorably, implying that this movie isn't as good in terms of scale or quality.\n\nPutting it together: The sentiment is negative because it's pointing out a lack of something positive and suggesting repetition without improvement.

However, \"lack of irony\" could imply they're taking it too seriously, which might be seen as negative because maybe they should have some irony or humor.\n\nNext part: \"reflects their earnestness.\" Earnestness is positive in terms of being serious and sincere, but depending on context, it can sometimes come off as overly so. But here, it's just stated neutrally.\n\nThen, the conclusion: \"which makes for a terrifying film.\" Terrifying is definitely negative because it evokes fear or dread.

The word \"constant\" here suggests that this type of humor is consistently present, which isn't inherently positive or negative but indicates a steady presence.\n\nNext, the phrase \"ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery.\" \"Buoyant\" means cheerful and light-hearted, which is a positive adjective.

The sentence starts by saying Michael Moore has \"perfected the art,\" which suggests mastery, so that's positive. Then, it describes his documentaries as \"highly entertaining\" \u2013 another positive term. \n\nNext part is \"self-aggrandizing.\" Hmm, self-aggrandizing usually means someone is promoting themselves excessively, which can be seen negatively. But in this context, since it's describing Moore's style and the sentence overall seems approving, maybe it's not a negative comment but rather an observation of his method.\n\nThen, \"politically motivated\" \u2013 depending on the perspective, that could be neutral or even positive if someone supports his politics. The text doesn't specify whether that's good or bad, just states it as a fact.\n\nFinally, he's said to have a \"potent topic,\" which again is positive because potent means strong and impactful.\n\nPutting it all together: most of the descriptors are positive (\"perfected,\" \"highly entertaining,\" \"potent\"). The self-aggrandizing could be a bit neutral or slightly negative, but overall, the sentiment seems more on the positive side. \n\nI think this leans towards 3 (positive). It's not extremely glowing with superlatives like 'amazing' or 'incredible,' so maybe not 4. So 3 is appropriate.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 3, 34.96557574099279], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the wording. The phrase starts with \"Not many movies,\" which suggests that the person isn't experiencing a lot of impactful films anymore. That could indicate a sense of disappointment or dissatisfaction because they're not finding the same level of engagement in movies as before.\n\nThe word \"impact\" is neutral on its own, but combined with \"these days,\" it might imply that previously, there were more impactful movies, and now they aren't. This comparison can lean towards negative because it's expressing a decline in something positive (movies having an impact) over time.\n\nPutting it together, the sentiment seems to be on the negative side. The person is probably feeling let down or sad about not finding movies as affecting as before. So, I think this would fall into either 0 (very negative) or 1 (negative). Since it's a bit of a personal observation rather than an intense complaint, maybe 1 is more appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is slightly negative due to the implied disappointment about movies lacking impact these days.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 4, 28.019010558986338], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the word given is \"imperfect.\" The question mark at the end might indicate a questioning tone or perhaps surprise, but I'm not sure if that affects the sentiment classification much here. Sentiment analysis usually looks for positivity or negativity in words and phrases.\n\nThe word \"imperfect\" itself typically has a negative connotation because it implies something is lacking, flawed, or not as good as it should be. So right off the bat, my initial thought is that this word leans towards negative sentiment.\n\nBut wait, could there be any positive nuance here? Sometimes words can have different meanings depending on context. For example, in some contexts, \"imperfect\" might refer to something that's intentionally designed to be less than perfect, which could be seen as a positive trait if it's intentional and the imperfection is desirable. However, without more context, I don't think we can assume that.\n\nSo, sticking with the general meaning, \"imperfect\" suggests something isn't up to standard or has flaws. That would typically be negative. Now, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive.\n\nSince \"imperfect\" is clearly not positive, it's either a 0 or 1. How strong is this negativity? Is it very negative (0) or just negative (1)? Well, \"imperfect\" isn't an extremely harsh word like \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" It's more of a mild criticism. So I think it falls under negative but not extremely so.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment should be classified as 1.\n</think>\n\nThe word \"imperfect\" has a negative connotation, indicating something is flawed or lacking. While it isn't extremely harsh, it still carries a negative tone. \n\n1", 1, 1, 41.37077894102549], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It mentions \"cinematic poetry,\" which sounds artistic and positive. \"Showcases\" is a positive verb, meaning it highlights something good. Then it talks about the city's \"old-world charm,\" which usually refers to something quaint or picturesque\u2014definitely a positive trait.\n\nHowever, the second part says \"before machines change nearly everything.\" This could imply that there's an impending change, maybe negative because machines might alter things for worse. But I'm not sure if this is meant as a critique or just a factual statement about progress.\n\nPutting it together: The first half is clearly positive, celebrating the city's charm through cinematic means. The second part hints at future changes but doesn't express a strong negative emotion\u2014it's more observational. So overall, the sentiment leans positive because it's highlighting the charm and using poetic language, with only a mild hint of change that isn't explicitly negative.\n\nI think the sentiment is neutral or slightly positive.

Using words like \"so well\" indicates approval or praise.\n\nThen there's the example given: \"even a simple 'goddammit!'\". This seems to highlight that even a straightforward exclamation is impactful because of how well it was written. The use of an expletive might seem negative, but in this context, it's showing that the writing is effective enough to make such a phrase stand out.\n\nPutting it together, the overall sentiment is positive.

Let me read the sentence again: \"If villainous vampires are your cup of blood, Blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the words used here. The phrase \"villainous vampires\" suggests something negative because villains are typically seen as bad guys. But then it says \"are your cup of blood,\" which might be a play on \"cup of tea,\" meaning someone's thing or interest. So maybe this isn't entirely negative.\n\nNext, the main part is about Blade 2 being \"definitely a cut above the rest.\" The phrase \"a cut above\" means something is better than others, so that sounds positive. So putting it all together, the sentence seems to be recommending Blade 2 positively, especially if you like villainous vampires.\n\nI don't see any negative words beyond the initial mention of villains, which might not carry a negative sentiment in this context since it's talking about what someone's interested in. The overall tone is praising Blade 2 for being better than other options. \n\nSo considering all that, the sentiment should be positive but maybe not extremely so. Since 4 is very positive and 3 is just positive, I think 3 fits here because while it's a positive statement, it doesn't use superlatives like \"excellent\" or \"amazing,\" which might push it to 4.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence praises Blade 2 as better than others, indicating a positive sentiment without extreme language. \n\nAnswer: 3", 3, 3, 34.251968701020814], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It's a serious literary work dealing with themes like sin, guilt, and societal judgment. The mention of it could be neutral because just naming the book doesn't convey any emotion.\n\nBut then there's an ellipsis after \"is a.\" So the sentence ends abruptly. That makes me think the user might have been about to give their opinion but didn't finish. Since there's no clear positive or negative words, like \"amazing\" or \"terrible,\" it's hard to gauge the sentiment. Maybe they were going to say something, but we don't know what.\n\nLooking at the structure, the sentence is incomplete. Without more context, I can't tell if the sentiment was heading towards positive or negative. The user could have been about to praise it or criticize it. But since there's nothing after \"is a,\" I have to go with neutral because no emotion is clearly expressed.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 2, 28.03484504899825], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text given is: \"a vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg 's brilliant ` videodrome .'\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the words and phrases used. The word \"vile\" is definitely negative\u2014it means something extremely unpleasant or disgusting. Then there's \"incoherent mess,\" which suggests that whatever is being described is confusing and poorly put together. That's also a negative assessment.\n\nNext, it says \"a scummy ripoff.\" \"Scummy\" again is negative, implying something sleazy or of low quality. And calling something a \"ripoff\" means it's an imitation without the original's qualities, which isn't complimentary. \n\nThe text then references David Cronenberg's \"Videodrome,\" calling it brilliant. So the person is comparing whatever they're talking about to this well-regarded film but in a negative way, saying it's just a ripoff. That reinforces the negative sentiment.\n\nPutting it all together: The language used is strongly critical and derogatory. Words like \"vile,\" \"incoherent mess,\" and \"scummy ripoff\" all convey strong dislike or dissatisfaction. There's no positive element here; even though they mention a brilliant film, it's only to contrast negatively with the subject.\n\nSo considering the options, 0 is very negative, which seems appropriate because of the intensity of the negative words used. It goes beyond just being negative (which would be 1) into a more severe criticism.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses strongly negative language such as \"vile,\" \"incoherent mess,\" and \"scummy ripoff,\" indicating a very negative sentiment.\n\n0", 0, 0, 39.77995550000924], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user gave me an example where they classified it as 2 (neutral), but let me go through my thought process step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the sentence: \"director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel.\" \n\nI notice some strong words here. \"Stomps\" and \"hobnail boots\" both have a negative connotation. Stomping usually implies someone is being harsh or aggressive, and hobnail boots are heavy, which adds to that idea of forcefulness. So, the director is being criticized for perhaps mishandling or disrespecting Natalie Babbitt's work.\n\nNatalie Babbitt's novel is described as \"gentle\" and \"endearing,\" which are positive adjectives. But the way the sentence is structured, it seems like the director is trampling over these qualities. The use of \"stomps\" suggests that the director's approach was rough or damaging to the original material.\n\nSo putting this together, the sentiment here is negative because it's criticizing how the director treated the novel. However, I don't think it's extremely negative; it's more of a moderate criticism rather than something very harsh. Therefore, on the scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive), I would rate this as a 1 for negative sentiment.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence uses strong words like \"stomps\" and \"hobnail boots,\" suggesting a harsh critique of how the director handled Natalie Babbitt's gentle novel.

The phrase \"worth taking\" suggests that there's value in doing so. So, it implies a positive experience or benefit.\n\nThe sentiment here isn't extremely strong; it's more of a recommendation without using very enthusiastic language.

The words used are \"too mainstream\" and \"too textbook,\" which both have a slightly critical tone. Mainstream can sometimes imply that something lacks originality or depth because it's too common or overdone. Similarly, calling the psychology \"textbook\" might suggest that it's predictable or not innovative enough.\n\nThe phrase ends with \"to intrigue,\" meaning that these elements (script and psychology) aren't engaging or interesting enough for the speaker. So, they're expressing disappointment or dissatisfaction with how predictable and unoriginal the script and psychological aspects are.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment scale: 0 is very negative, which would be if the text was full of strong criticism. The text here does express some negativity but isn't extremely harsh; there's no use of stronger words like \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" It's more of a mild criticism.\n\nNeutral (2) wouldn't fit because there's a clear negative sentiment expressed. Positive (3 or 4) is definitely out since the critique is about lacking intrigue, which is a negative point.\n\nSo, it's either between 1 (negative) and maybe even considering if it's very negative. However, I think the criticism here isn't as strong as some other negative statements might be. It's pointing out that things are too mainstream or textbook without using harsher language.\n\nI'll go with 1 because the sentiment is negative but not extremely so.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to the critique of predictability and lack of originality, though not extremely so. \n\n1", 1, 1, 37.12113200200838], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me read it again: \"suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997.\" Hmm.\n\nFirst, breaking down the words. \"Suffers\" is a negative word because it implies something bad happening. Then \"over-familiarity\" suggests that something has become too common or maybe tiresome, which isn't great. \n\nNext part: \"hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997.\" \"Hit-hungry\" indicates they're desperate for hits, which might lead to poor quality. \"Strip-mined\" is a strong term, implying exploitation or excessive use. Using it on \"the monty formula\" (which I think refers to the Monty Python style) and doing so \"mercilessly\" adds more negativity.\n\nPutting it all together, the text seems critical of how British filmmakers have overused the Monty Python approach since 1997. It's saying that this overuse has made things suffer from being too familiar, which is a negative sentiment.\n\nSo considering the scale: 0 for very negative, up to 4 for very positive. The text isn't extremely harsh, but it does convey criticism and disappointment. I think it's more on the negative side but not the most extreme. Maybe a 1? Or perhaps just below neutral at 2? But \"suffers\" and \"mercilessly\" lean towards being quite negative, so maybe 0 or 1.\n\nWait, is there any positive spin here? Not really. It's all about overuse leading to problems. So probably in the negative range. If I had to choose between 0 (very negative) and 1 (negative), I might say it's more of a 0 because \"mercilessly\" and \"suffers\" are strong words. But maybe it's not extremely so, just quite negative. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if it's somewhat negative but not the most severe, perhaps 1 is better.

It mentions it's an action movie featuring an action icon, which sounds neutral or maybe slightly positive because action movies are generally popular. However, the key part here is \"who's been all but decommissioned.\" Decommissioning usually implies something is being retired or taken out of service, so that could have a negative connotation.\n\nPutting it together: The movie is about an icon who's almost retired. That might suggest themes like decline or ending, which can be seen as somewhat negative. But since it's still an action movie, maybe the overall sentiment isn't too harsh. It doesn't express strong negativity but leans more towards a neutral or slightly negative view because of the decommissioning aspect.\n\nSo, considering 0 is very negative and 2 is neutral, I think this might be a 1 (negative). The text hints at something ending, which isn't positive, but it's not overly harsh either.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment of the text leans towards slightly negative due to the mention of decommissioning. \n\n1", 1, 1, 25.759947029000614], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence given is: \"A gem, captured in the unhurried, low-key style favored by many directors of the Iranian new wave.\" Hmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst off, the word \"gem\" stands out. That usually means something precious or excellent, so that's a positive sign. It's like saying the film is a jewel, which is definitely a compliment.\n\nThen there's the part about being captured in an \"unhurried, low-key style.\" I think that describes the pacing and tone of the film. Unhurried suggests it doesn't rush, taking its time to develop, which can be seen as positive because it allows for deeper storytelling or character development. Low-key might mean subtle or understated, which can also be a good thing if it's intentional and adds depth.\n\nNext, it mentions \"favored by many directors of the Iranian new wave.\" That part indicates that this style is respected and used by notable filmmakers in that movement. So, associating the film with these directors could be another positive point because it ties it to a well-regarded cinematic tradition.\n\nPutting it all together: The text seems to praise the film for its quality (gem) and its deliberate, understated approach, which is appreciated within a recognized group of directors. There's no negative language here; everything points towards approval and admiration.\n\nSo on the scale from 0 to 4, with 4 being very positive, this should be a solid 3 or even 4. But since it doesn't use superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"brilliant,\" just \"gem,\" maybe 3 is more accurate as it's positive but not extremely so.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses complimentary terms and references to respected cinematic traditions, indicating a positive sentiment.\n\n3", 3, 2, 37.97041681499104], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me read the text again: \"it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down each part. The sentence starts by saying it's about what Costner movies are known for, which could be neutral if just stating facts, but then adds more descriptive words.\n\nThe adjectives used here are \"sanctimonious\" and \"self-righteous.\" Both of these have negative connotations. Sanctimonious means someone is pretending to be morally superior, which can come off as insincere or annoying. Self-righteous implies that the person believes they're always right, often without considering others' viewpoints.\n\nThe next part says it's so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it. This suggests frustration and dislike. Eagerly seeking approval can be seen as desperate or overbearing, leading the speaker to feel annoyed enough to slap it metaphorically. That's a strong negative emotion.\n\nPutting it all together: The text is criticizing Costner movies by using harsh adjectives and expressing frustration. There's no positive language here; everything points towards dislike and annoyance. So, I think this sentiment is negative but not the most extreme.

The user provided that 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 is neutral, 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive. So my task is to determine where \"mildly amusing\" falls into these categories.\n\nThe phrase in question is \"mildly amusing.\" Let's dissect the words here. \"Amusing\" generally means something that causes laughter or enjoyment; it's a positive term. However, it's modified by the word \"mildly,\" which suggests that the level of amusement isn't very strong\u2014it's just a little funny or entertaining.\n\nSo putting that together, if someone says something is mildly amusing, they're indicating a slightly positive feeling but not an overwhelmingly positive one. It's more on the lower end of positivity rather than a high, enthusiastic sentiment.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), 4 (very positive). Since \"mildly amusing\" is positive but not extremely so, it doesn't reach the level of very positive. It's just a bit on the positive side.\n\nI should also think about similar phrases to compare. For example, if someone says something is \"amusing,\" that might be a 3. If they say \"very amusing,\" that could be a 4. On the flip side, a negative sentiment would involve words like \"annoying\" or \"frustrating.\" Since we're dealing with a positive modifier here, but a mild one, it's not as strong as a pure positive.\n\nIs there any chance this could be neutral? Neutral is 2, which means neither positive nor negative. But since \"amusing\" is inherently positive, even if mildly so, it still leans towards positive rather than being neutral. So I don't think it's a 2.\n\nTherefore, putting all that together, \"mildly amusing\" should be classified as a 3 because it expresses a positive sentiment, albeit not an extremely strong one.\n</think>\n\nThe phrase \"mildly amusing\" conveys a slight positive sentiment without being overly enthusiastic.

It starts by saying the movie is \"clever and funny.\" Those are both positive adjectives, so that's a good sign. Clever suggests intelligence or originality, which is a compliment. Funny obviously means it made people laugh, which is enjoyable.\n\nNext part: \"amused by its special effects.\" Amused here implies that the person found the special effects entertaining and probably impressive enough to keep them engaged. So that's another positive point.\n\nThen it says, \"leaves you feeling like you've seen a movie instead of an endless trailer.\" This seems a bit tricky. The comparison is between the movie experience and an endless trailer. Trailers are usually short, so comparing a movie to an endless one might imply that the movie felt longer or more substantial than expected. But since it's phrased as leaving you feeling like you've seen a movie (which is positive) rather than an endless trailer, which could be negative if it means the movie was too long or boring, but in this context, I think it's more about the satisfaction of having watched something complete and worthwhile.\n\nPutting it all together: clever, funny, amused by effects, satisfying like a full movie. These are all positive sentiments without any negative words. There's no criticism here; everything points towards a favorable opinion. So the sentiment is definitely on the positive side.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit at all. 1 would be negative, but again, there's nothing negative here. Neutral (2) might be if it was just factual or mixed, but the text clearly shows appreciation. Positive (3) and very positive (4). The adjectives used are strong\u2014clever, funny, amusing\u2014but does it reach a 4? Maybe not extremely, but leaning towards 3 because while all points are positive, there's no superlatives like \"incredible\" or \"amazing.\" It's solidly positive.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Clever and funny are strong positives, amused by special effects is another plus, and the last part suggests it was a satisfying experience compared to something less substantial (a trailer). So maybe it's more than just positive\u2014it's quite positive. So perhaps 4? Or is 3 sufficient?\n\nHmm. Maybe because it doesn't use superlatives beyond \"clever\" and \"funny,\" which are strong but not the strongest possible terms. It could be a 3 or a 4. But considering all aspects, I think it's a solid positive without being extremely so, so maybe 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, given that it's clever, funny, amusing effects, and leaves you feeling like you've seen a movie\u2014those are strong endorsements. Maybe it does warrant a 4 as very positive because the overall experience is praised in multiple ways.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is highly positive due to the use of complimentary adjectives and the satisfaction conveyed about the movie experience.\n\n4", 4, 3, 69.00391598901479], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts with \"a return to pure Disney magic,\" which sounds positive because words like \"pure\" and \"magic\" are associated with something good and enjoyable. Then it says \"is enjoyable family fare.\" The word \"enjoyable\" is clearly a positive adjective, and \"family fare\" suggests that it's suitable for families, which is generally seen as a positive aspect.\n\nPutting this together, both parts of the sentence have positive connotations. There are no negative words or phrases present. Therefore, I think the sentiment is definitely positive. Since 3 represents positive and 4 very positive, I need to decide if it's just positive or very positive. The use of \"pure Disney magic\" might lean towards a stronger positive sentiment because it evokes nostalgia and excitement. However, without more extreme words like \"amazing\" or \"perfect,\" maybe it's not the highest level.\n\nConsidering all this, I would classify the sentiment as 3 (positive).\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses positive sentiments with terms like \"pure Disney magic\" and \"enjoyable family fare.\"\n\n3", 3, 4, 28.2073747679824], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase starts with talking about the 20th outing having stamina and vitality. Stamina usually implies endurance or energy, which is positive. Vitality suggests life and vigor, so that's also a positive sign.\n\nNext part: \"get this, Madonna's cameo doesn't suck!\" The word \"doesn't suck\" means it's good; it's not bad. So saying that her cameo doesn't suck is a positive statement because it's expressing approval or satisfaction.\n\nPutting it together: Both parts of the sentence are positive. There's no negative language here except for the word \"suck,\" but in this context, it's used to say that something does not suck, which flips the meaning to positive.\n\nSo overall sentiment is positive. Now, on the scale:\n\n0 - very negative\n1 - negative\n2 - neutral\n3 - positive\n4 - very positive\n\nThe text is definitely positive. How strong? The use of \"shows off a lot\" and \"doesn't suck\" with an exclamation mark suggests enthusiasm. So it's more than just positive; it's quite positive.\n\nBut does it reach \"very positive\"? Hmm, maybe not super strong superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"fantastic,\" but still pretty positive.\n\nWait, the first part talks about stamina and vitality, which are strong positives. The second part is about a cameo not being bad, which could have been neutral or slightly negative if it had sucked, but here it's stated as a positive.\n\nSo maybe this is leaning towards 3 (positive) because while both parts are good, the exclamation mark adds some enthusiasm, making it more than just neutral.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 3, 41.77344956199522], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

First, the main subject is a film. The descriptors are \"contemporary political resonance\" and \"winning family story.\" \n\nThe phrase \"contemporary political resonance\" suggests that the film deals with current political issues. Depending on how those issues are portrayed, this could be positive or negative. But without more context, it's hard to tell if the political aspect is being praised or criticized.\n\nNext, \"a winning family story\" likely refers to a heartwarming or successful family narrative. The word \"winning\" here probably means that the story is engaging and positive. This part definitely leans towards positivity because \"winning\" implies success or triumph.\n\nPutting it together, the sentence seems to highlight both the political aspect and the family story as strengths of the film. Even though politics can be divisive, the use of \"resonance\" might indicate that the film effectively conveys its message without necessarily being negative. The family story part is clearly positive, which could make the overall sentiment more on the positive side.\n\nI should also consider if there's any sarcasm or negative undertone here. The sentence sounds like a review or a description meant to highlight the film's merits. Words like \"winning\" and \"illustrated by\" suggest that both elements are seen as positives contributing to the film's quality.\n\nSo, balancing the political resonance which could be neutral but is paired with a positive family story, I think the overall sentiment leans towards positive. It doesn't seem overly enthusiastic (which would be very positive), so maybe a 3. Alternatively, if \"winning\" makes it more upbeat, perhaps a 4? But since the other part is about political resonance without clear positivity, I might go with 3 as the safer choice.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment of the sentence is positive due to the use of terms like \"winning family story,\" indicating an engaging and successful narrative. However, the mention of \"contemporary political resonance\" could be neutral depending on context. Overall, it leans towards a positive sentiment but isn't overly enthusiastic.\n\n3", 3, 3, 49.95935606901185], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts with \"alas,\" which is often used to express sorrow or regret. So that gives a hint of a negative emotion. Then it says, \"it's the man that makes the clothes.\" The structure here seems like the speaker is pointing out someone's role in making clothes, but maybe they're not happy about it.\n\nI wonder if there's any sarcasm or irony here. Sometimes people use \"alas\" ironically when they're actually upset. But without more context, it's a bit hard to tell. The phrase could be expressing disappointment that the man is responsible for making clothes instead of something else, which might imply dissatisfaction. Alternatively, maybe it's just stating a fact with a sense of melancholy.\n\nI should consider possible interpretations. If \"alas\" is genuine, then the sentiment would lean towards negative or very negative. But if it's being used in a different way, like highlighting someone's skill, it could be positive. However, given that \"alas\" is often associated with sadness, I think the sentiment here is at least somewhat negative.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the use of \"alas\" suggests some level of negativity, and the statement about the man making clothes might be pointing out a situation the speaker isn't happy with. Therefore, I would classify this as negative. The scale has 0 for very negative, 1 for negative, so probably a 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is classified as negative due to the use of \"alas,\" which conveys sorrow or regret.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 3, 39.618424082000274], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase \"weaves us into\" suggests that the plot is engaging or immersive. That sounds positive because being drawn into a story is usually seen as a good thing. Then there's \"a complex web.\" Complexity can be interpreted in different ways. It could mean the plot is intricate and layered, which might be viewed positively because it adds depth and interest. Alternatively, complexity could imply confusion or difficulty, but I think in storytelling context, it's more likely to be seen as a positive aspect.\n\nSo putting it together: \"the plot weaves us into a complex web.\" The use of \"weaves\" suggests an active engagement, pulling the reader in, which is positive. The \"complex web\" adds depth, so overall, this seems like a positive sentiment about the plot's structure and engagement.\n\nNow, considering the scale from 0 to 4: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. Since the sentiment is positive but not extremely so, I would rate it as 3 (positive). It doesn't use superlatives like \"incredible\" or \"fantastic,\" which might push it to 4.

The first part says that \"the hours doesn't connect in a neat way.\" This could be interpreted as negative because it suggests that the movie's structure or plot isn't coherent or straightforward for the audience. Maybe the pacing is off or the narrative isn't engaging.\n\nThe second part mentions that the movie introduces characters who illuminate mysteries of sex, duty, and love. These are deep themes, and the use of \"illuminate\" suggests that the characters effectively explore these topics. This seems positive because it indicates depth and meaningful exploration in the film.\n\nNow, balancing these two points: the first is somewhat negative, but not extremely so. It's more about a critique of structure rather than outright dislike. The second part is clearly positive as it praises the character development and themes.\n\nSo, I'm thinking this isn't a very strong negative (0) or neutral (2). It's leaning towards positive because despite the structural criticism, the exploration of deep themes adds significant value. But it's not extremely positive either because of that initial critique. Therefore, it should be a 3 \u2013 positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text mentions both a negative aspect (\"doesn't connect in a neat way\") and a positive one (\"introduces characters who illuminate mysteries\").

The use of \"ultimately fails\" is strong and suggests disappointment or dissatisfaction.\n\nPutting it together, the sentiment seems negative. But how negative? It doesn't use extreme words like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" just points out a failure in the film's execution regarding the dragons. So maybe not extremely negative (which would be 0), but still clearly on the negative side. \n\nI think it's a solid negative, so perhaps a 1.

It mentions it's a coming-of-age film, which is generally seen positively because these films often tackle personal growth and self-discovery. But then it says it avoids \"cartoonish clich\u00e9s\" and \"sneering humor.\" The use of 'avoids' here suggests that those elements are typically negative or overused in the genre. So by avoiding them, the film is doing something better.\n\nNext part: \"provides a fresh view of an old type.\" Fresh implies newness and originality, which is positive. It's talking about an uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood, which sounds like it's dealing with genuine emotions and experiences, adding depth to the character rather than relying on stereotypes or over-the-top humor.\n\nPutting it all together: The text is praising the film for not falling into common pitfalls and instead offering something original and heartfelt.

Let's break down the sentence step by step.\n\nThe sentence is: \"while guzm\u00e1n frustratingly refuses to give pinochet 's crimes a political context , his distance from the material is mostly admirable.\"\n\nFirst, I'll split it into two parts. The first part says that Guzm\u00e1n frustratingly refuses to provide a political context for Pinochet's crimes. Using words like \"frustratingly\" indicates frustration or dissatisfaction, which leans towards negative sentiment.\n\nThen, the second part mentions his distance from the material is mostly admirable. \"Admirable\" suggests approval and positivity. The word \"mostly\" softens this a bit, but it's still positive overall.\n\nSo, I have two sentiments here: one negative and one positive. Now, which one is stronger? The first part is critical of Guzm\u00e1n's approach, while the second part praises his distance from the material. The positive aspect seems to counterbalance the negative but not entirely outweigh it because the frustration is directed at a refusal to provide context, which could be seen as significant.\n\nConsidering both aspects, the sentiment isn't extremely negative or positive. It's somewhere in the middle. However, since there's a slight positivity from \"admirable,\" I might lean towards neutral but with a hint of positivity. But given that the first part is critical and more emphasized, maybe it's closer to neutral.\n\nWait, but the sentence structure uses \"while\" which contrasts the two ideas. So the main point seems to be highlighting both sides: frustration on one side and admiration on the other.

The user provided a specific scale: 0 for very negative, 1 for negative, 2 for neutral, 3 for positive, and 4 for very positive. \n\nLooking at the given text: \"... hokey art house pretension.\" Hmm, let me break this down. \"Hokey\" usually means something that's overly sentimental or not genuine in a way that feels insincere. It can be used to criticize something as being too cheesy or fake. \n\nThen there's \"art house,\" which typically refers to films or art that's more experimental, intellectual, or for a niche audience. On its own, \"art house\" doesn't carry much sentiment; it's just descriptive. However, when combined with the word \"pretension,\" things change.\n\n\"Pretension\" means an affected or exaggerated attempt to appear clever or sophisticated. So putting it all together: \"hokey art house pretension\" seems to be criticizing something as trying too hard to be artistic or intellectual in a way that's insincere or off-putting. \n\nThe use of \"hokey\" adds a layer of dismissal, implying the attempt isn't effective and comes across as forced rather than genuine. So overall, this phrase is expressing a negative sentiment towards whatever is being referred to\u2014likely a movie, art piece, or similar.\n\nNow, thinking about the scale: 0 is very negative, which would mean extremely harsh or strongly negative. I'm not sure if \"hokey art house pretension\" reaches that level. It's definitely negative but maybe not extremely so. \n\nSo perhaps it falls under 1 for negative. There's criticism here, but it's more about being insincere rather than outright hostile or offensive. The sentiment is clearly unfavorable but doesn't seem to reach the very negative category.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this as a 1 on the scale.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a negative sentiment due to the use of \"hokey\" and \"pretension,\" which criticize something as insincere and overly ambitious.

The sentence provided is: \"when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .\"\n\nFirst, I'll read through the sentence to understand its meaning. It says that if someone ends up supporting the monsters in a horror film, they realize the movie isn't good. Rooting for the monsters implies that maybe the protagonists aren't likable or the story is so bad that even the antagonists seem more interesting.\n\nThe phrase \"you know the picture is in trouble\" clearly indicates that something is wrong with the movie. The word \"trouble\" has a negative connotation, suggesting failure or issues. So, the overall sentiment here is negative because it's pointing out a flaw in the film.\n\nNow, considering the scale from 0 to 4: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, and so on. Since the sentence directly states that the movie is in trouble, which is a strong negative statement, I think it falls into the negative category but not extremely so. So maybe it's a 1.\n\nWait, could it be more than just slightly negative? The statement isn't just a minor criticism; it suggests that the movie has a significant problem because people are rooting against the intended heroes. That seems like a strong critique. Maybe it should be classified as very negative (0). But \"in trouble\" doesn't sound as harsh as \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" It's more of an observation about the movie's flaws rather than outright condemnation.\n\nHmm, perhaps 1 is appropriate because while it's negative, it's not the most extreme.

The main words here are \"a mess\" and the structure \"from start to finish.\" The phrase \"is a mess\" is pretty strong in terms of negativity. When someone describes something as a mess, especially a movie, it usually means it's chaotic, disorganized, or didn't make sense. \n\nThen, adding \"from start to finish\" emphasizes that this problem isn't just a part of the movie but runs throughout the entire duration. It suggests that every part was bad, which makes the sentiment even more negative.\n\nI should consider if there are any other words or phrases that might influence the sentiment. The word \"mess\" is clearly negative, and the rest of the sentence doesn't add anything positive. There's no attempt to balance it with positives; it's all about the negative aspects.\n\nSo putting this together, the sentiment is definitely negative. Now, I have to decide between 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), or maybe even a neutral score if there was some ambiguity.

Adding \"unlikely\" suggests that this journey isn't the typical one, maybe making it more interesting or unique\u2014still leaning towards positive.\n\nThen we have \"featuring a pathetic, endearing hero.\" Now, \"pathetic\" can be tricky because it usually means someone is pitiful or\u53ef\u601c\u7684\uff0cwhich might seem negative. But in context, when paired with \"endearing,\" it softens that. An endearing person is likable despite flaws, so the hero's pathos makes him relatable and perhaps more engaging.\n\nThe phrase \"all too human\" suggests relatability\u2014this hero has human flaws, which can make him more realistic and sympathetic. That\u2019s a positive aspect because it connects emotionally with readers or viewers.\n\nPutting it all together: The text is describing something as hilarious, praised, featuring a likable but flawed hero. The overall tone seems very positive. Words like \"hilarious,\" \"ode,\" \"endearing,\" and \"all too human\" contribute to a favorable sentiment. So on the scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive), this should be a 4.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses words like \"hilarious,\" \"ode,\" \"endearing,\" and \"all too human,\" which indicate a very positive sentiment.\n\n4", 4, 3, 40.308448266994674], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

So when they say Resurrection has this, it's not a good thing.\n\nThen, \"really bad imitation of the really bad Blair Witch Project.\" Here, both parts are negative: it's a bad imitation and it's imitating something else that was already considered bad. So calling it a bad imitation of another bad movie adds to the negativity.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence is expressing strong disapproval. They're not just saying it's bad; they're comparing it unfavorably to another bad example, which makes the sentiment even more negative. \n\nSo, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, and the sentence fits that because of the strong negative language used without any positive aspects mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe statement uses strongly negative language, referring to \"really bad imitation\" and a \"dubious distinction,\" indicating a very negative sentiment.\n\n0", 0, 1, 26.35261144398828], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me read through the text again: \"... may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence.\" \n\nFirst, I notice that the phrase \"addictive guilty pleasure\" is often used in a somewhat positive or at least neutral way. It suggests that something is enjoyable despite maybe not being the highest quality. So that part might lean towards positive.\n\nBut then there's the second part: \"the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence.\" The words here are more negative. \"Questionable\" implies doubt about the value or effectiveness, and \"satirical ambivalence\" suggests uncertainty or a lack of clear direction in the satire, which might make it less impactful or confusing.\n\nPutting it together, the text seems to acknowledge some positive aspects but also points out significant flaws. The first part is somewhat positive, but the second part is clearly negative. I think the overall sentiment leans more towards neutral because there's both a positive and a negative point. However, since the negative aspect is about not overcoming something questionable, it might tip it slightly into being negative.\n\nSo considering all that, I'm leaning towards a 2 (neutral) or maybe a 1 (negative). But given the mention of \"addictive guilty pleasure,\" which is a positive note, but balanced against the critical view of the material's satirical ambivalence, it might not be entirely neutral. Alternatively, perhaps it's slightly negative because the flaws are highlighted as significant.\n\nHmm, I'm still a bit unsure. Let me break it down again: Positive elements - \"addictive guilty pleasure.\" Negative elements - \"questionable,\" \"never overcomes,\" \"ambivalence.\" The positives might not outweigh the negatives here, so maybe 1 (negative) is more accurate.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 1, 40.6694288450235], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The words used here are positive. Words like \"brilliantly\" stand out as strong positive adjectives. They describe how Payne and Taylor use their quirky and fearless approach.\n\nThe phrase \"look American angst in the eye and end up laughing\" suggests that they tackle tough or anxious themes but manage to find humor in them. The word \"laughing\" indicates a positive outcome despite dealing with angst, which is generally negative. So turning something potentially sad into laughter shows a positive sentiment.\n\nPutting it all together, the text praises their work, uses strong positive language, and highlights how they successfully handle difficult subjects by finding humor.

It starts with \"a good film,\" which immediately suggests a positive sentiment because \"good\" is a positive adjective. Then it mentions \"a solid pedigree both in front of and... behind the camera.\" The word \"solid\" here reinforces that the film has a strong background or foundation, both from the actors (in front) and the crew (behind), which are good things.\n\nI don't see any negative words like bad, poor, or sad. Everything seems to be pointing towards positive aspects of the film. The structure is straightforward with no sarcasm or irony that I can detect. So, putting it all together, the sentiment expressed is definitely positive.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, which doesn't apply here. 1 is negative, also not applicable. Neutral would be a 2, but since the text clearly praises the film, that's not right either. Positive options are 3 and 4. The use of \"good\" and \"solid pedigree\" suggests it's more than just positive; maybe very positive because it's highlighting strong points both in acting and production.\n\nWait, but is \"very positive\" too strong? It says \"a good film,\" which isn't the most enthusiastic praise. However, the addition of \"solid pedigree behind the camera\" adds depth to the positivity. So perhaps it leans towards a 3 rather than a 4 because while it's definitely positive, it doesn't use superlatives like excellent or outstanding.\n\nAlternatively, considering that both aspects are praised (actors and crew), maybe it does warrant a higher score.

The phrase starts with \"the road paved with good intentions,\" which immediately makes me think of the idiom \"The road to hell is paved with good intentions.\" That's a common saying that suggests even though you start with good intentions, things can go wrong or lead to negative outcomes.\n\nSo in this case, instead of leading somewhere bad like hell, it leads to a video store. Video stores aren't inherently positive or negative; they're just places where people rent movies or buy DVDs. But considering the original idiom's context, which is about unintended negative consequences, I might infer that the outcome here isn't as bad as hell but still not great.\n\nThe sentiment expressed seems to be slightly negative because it's pointing out that good intentions didn't lead to a particularly meaningful or positive destination. It could imply that the efforts were misplaced or didn't achieve something worthwhile, hence leaning towards a negative sentiment without being extremely so.\n\nI don't think it's neutral because there's a slight criticism implied by using the idiom. It's not outright negative either; more like mildly critical.

The user has provided a sentence: \"... watching it was painful.\" and they want me to classify its sentiment on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the sentence. The phrase \"watching it was painful\" suggests that the experience of watching something\u2014maybe a movie, show, or event\u2014was unpleasant. The word \"painful\" is a strong indicator here. It's not just a minor inconvenience; it's something that caused actual discomfort or distress.\n\nNext, I should consider the sentiment scale provided. 0 is very negative, which implies extreme dissatisfaction or distress. Since the user used the word \"painful,\" this seems to fit into that category because it conveys significant unpleasantness. \n\nI should also think about other possible interpretations but in this case, \"painful\" doesn't seem ambiguous. It's a clear indicator of a very negative experience without any positive nuances. There are no mitigating factors mentioned, like \"could have been better,\" which might make the sentiment slightly less negative.\n\nAdditionally, considering the structure of the sentence, it's straightforward and direct. The user isn't using metaphors or euphemisms that could be interpreted in multiple ways. It's a clear statement of how watching something felt to them.\n\nI should also think about whether there are any other words that might influence the sentiment more than \"painful,\" but in this case, it's the only descriptive word provided. The context around \"it\" isn't specified, so I have to base my judgment solely on the given information.\n\nMoreover, looking at similar sentences for comparison helps. If someone says watching something was a pleasure or enjoyable, that would be positive. Conversely, using words like terrible, horrible, or excruciating also indicate negative sentiments but might vary in intensity. Here, \"painful\" is quite strong, so it leans towards the more severe end of the negative spectrum.\n\nLastly, I need to ensure that my classification aligns with the user's instructions precisely. They specified only integers from 0 to 4, and I must choose one. Given all this analysis, 0 seems appropriate because \"painful\" indicates a very negative sentiment.\n</think>\n\n0", 0, 1, 45.0357426610135], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user wants me to output a number between 0 and 4, where each number represents a different level of positivity or negativity.\n\nFirst, let's look at the sentence: \"it's a fun adventure movie for kids -lrb- of all ages -rrb- that like adventure.\" So, breaking it down, the key words here are \"fun\" and \"adventure.\" Both of these are positive terms. The phrase is describing a movie as fun and suitable for kids, which implies it's enjoyable.\n\nI need to consider if there are any negative words or phrases. I don't see any negative adjectives or sentiments expressed here. It's all about the positive aspects\u2014enjoyment and suitability for children.\n\nThe structure of the sentence is also important. It starts with \"it's a fun adventure movie,\" which immediately sets a positive tone. Then it clarifies that it's suitable for kids, but also notes it's for \"all ages,\" meaning it's not just limited to children, which adds a broader appeal and positivity.\n\nThere are no negative modifiers or any hints of criticism. The entire sentence seems aimed at recommending the movie as enjoyable and entertaining, especially highlighting its suitability for a wide audience.\n\nSo putting this together, the sentiment is definitely positive. Now, deciding between 3 and 4\u2014since \"fun\" and \"adventure\" are strong positives, but it's not overly enthusiastic beyond that. Maybe 3 because it's clearly positive without superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"incredible.\" But wait, considering the context, it's a fun movie for all ages, which is quite positive. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the scale: 4 being very positive, this could qualify because it's recommended as fun and suitable for everyone, which speaks well of its appeal and positive reception.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 4, 38.923251906002406], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Then there are terms like \"distracting special effects\" and \"visual party tricks.\" The word \"distracting\" suggests that these effects are more of a hindrance than helpful, making it hard to focus on the main content.\n\nThe uncertainty at the end\u2014\"it's not clear whether we're supposed to shriek or laugh\"\u2014indicates confusion about the reaction. This could mean the experience is either overwhelming or underwhelming, but leaning towards negative because it's unclear and perhaps even off-putting.\n\nPutting it all together, the text seems critical of the excessive use of special effects that might not serve a clear purpose, leading to a mixed or confused reaction.

The first part says that bacon makes things interesting, which seems positive because it's engaging or enjoyable. That could be a point towards positivity.\n\nThe second part advises not to go out of your way to pay full price. This suggests that while bacon is good, it's not worth the full price. So, the sentiment here is mixed\u2014there's appreciation for the product but also a caution against overpaying.\n\nLooking at the overall tone, there's a slight positivity from \"keeps things interesting\" but a more negative implication in the second part about not justifying the cost. The word \"but\" indicates a contrast between the two ideas. \n\nI should consider how strong each sentiment is. The positive aspect is present but qualified by the negative advice. It's not extremely positive or negative, so it falls somewhere in the middle.

The user provided a quote comparing a movie to works by Pasolini and Almod\u00f3var but in a negative light.

Pasolini's films are known for being passionate and politically charged, so removing those elements would make them less impactful. Then it compares to an Almod\u00f3var movie without beauty or humor. Both directors are famous for their distinctive styles that include these elements.\n\nThe phrase \"and you have some idea of the glum, numb experience\" directly describes watching \"O Fantasma\". The words \"glum\" and \"numb\" are clearly negative. \"Glum\" suggests a sad or gloomy mood, while \"numb\" implies a lack of feeling or engagement. So overall, the sentiment here is quite negative.\n\nI don't see any positive words in there. It's all about what's lacking\u2014passion, politics, beauty, humor\u2014and how that makes watching the movie feel bad. There's no neutral ground either because it's actively describing a poor experience.\n\nSo putting it all together, this text expresses a very negative sentiment towards the film \"O Fantasma\".

The sentence is: \"Life or something like it has its share of high points, but it misses too many opportunities.\"\n\nFirst, I notice that there are two main parts connected by a comma and the word \"but.\" The first part says life has \"high points,\" which sounds positive. High points usually mean good experiences or highlights.\n\nThen, after the \"but,\" the sentence takes a turn. It mentions that it \"misses too many opportunities.\" That's definitely negative because missing opportunities implies that something wasn't achieved or utilized as it should have been.\n\nSo combining these two parts: there are some positive aspects, but they're overshadowed by more negatives. The overall tone seems to lean towards the negative side because of the emphasis on missed opportunities.\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment scale provided: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. Since there's a balance but with a stronger negative element, it's not extremely negative (which would be 0), but definitely more on the negative side than neutral.\n\nI think this should be classified as a 1 because while there are some positives mentioned, the negatives carry more weight in the sentence.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 2, 26.539634217013372], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Adding \"more\" intensifies that positivity\u2014it's not just entertaining but even more so than before.\n\nPutting it together, the sentence seems to express a positive sentiment.

It's talking about the creators of something called \"don't ask don't tell.\" From what I know, \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" is a policy that was used by the U.S. military regarding homosexuality. But in this context, it seems to be referring to a movie or perhaps a work of some sort since it mentions creators and their own jokes.\n\nThe key part here is \"laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes.\" The phrase \"a hell of a lot\" is a colloquial way of saying a lot, but with a bit more intensity. So the creators were laughing a lot, which suggests they found their own work funny. That usually indicates that they enjoyed what they created, implying some positivity.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's any negative connotation here. The word \"hell\" can sometimes have a negative tone, but in this context, it's just adding emphasis and isn't directed negatively towards anything else. So the overall sentiment seems positive because the creators are laughing a lot at their own jokes, which is a good sign.\n\nBut I should also think about why they're laughing. If the creators laughed a lot, does that mean the content was funny? Or could it be that the situation they were in was stressful but they found humor despite that? However, given the wording, it seems more like they genuinely found their jokes amusing rather than using humor as a coping mechanism.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment expressed is positive because it shows enjoyment and success in creating something funny.

The phrase starts with \"a solid,\" which usually has a positive connotation. \"Solid\" suggests something reliable, strong, maybe even of good quality. So that's a positive indicator.\n\nNext is \"unassuming.\" Unassuming typically means modest or not showy, which can be seen as a positive trait because it implies humility and perhaps authenticity. It might also mean that the drama isn't trying too hard to impress, which could be appealing to some viewers.\n\nPutting these together, \"a solid, unassuming drama\" seems to describe something that's dependable and genuine without being flashy. That leans more towards a positive sentiment because both words carry favorable meanings.\n\nNow, considering the scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, I need to place this somewhere in the middle to upper range since it's positive but not overly so. \"Solid\" isn't extremely positive; it's just reliable. Similarly, \"unassuming\" doesn't add a lot of excitement but does contribute a positive nuance.\n\nSo, if 3 is positive and 4 is very positive, I might think about whether this text feels more like a 3 or a 4. However, since both descriptors are somewhat moderate in their positivity without any superlatives, it's probably safer to go with 2, neutral.

Then there's \"violent.\" Violence can be both positive or negative depending on context. In some genres like action or thriller, violence is expected and might not carry a negative sentiment but rather excitement.\n\nThe phrase \"momentum that never lets up\" also sounds positive.

Let's break down the sentence.\n\nThe text is: \"it 's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .\"\n\nFirst, I notice the phrase \"piece of handiwork.\" That could be neutral or slightly positive depending on context. Then it mentions \"shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams,\" which sounds a bit critical, like pointing out flaws. The word \"tatters\" might imply something is worn or not perfect, so that's leaning negative.\n\nHowever, the sentence continues with \"but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety.\" This part seems positive because \"quietly moving\" suggests emotional impact, and \"intelligent subtlety\" is a compliment on depth. \n\nSo there are both negative and positive elements here. The first part talks about imperfections, but the latter part highlights strengths. It's balanced, so maybe it's neutral overall. There's no strong emotion leaning one way or the other; it's more of an evaluation with mixed points.\n\nI think the sentiment isn't very negative because while there are criticisms, they're offset by positive aspects. It doesn't express extreme feelings either way. So probably a 2 for neutral.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 3, 30.969901068980107], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase starts by mentioning that the movie or show has \"flaws,\" which is a negative point. However, it quickly transitions with \"but\" to highlight positive aspects: humor, heart, and very talented young actors. These are all positive descriptors.\n\nI need to consider both parts of the sentence. On one hand, there's criticism about flaws, but on the other, there are strong compliments about the elements that make the production enjoyable. The structure uses \"but\" to emphasize the positives over the negatives, which suggests a more positive sentiment overall despite acknowledging some shortcomings.\n\nSince the output needs to be an integer between 0 and 4, with 0 being very negative and 4 very positive, I think this leans towards positive but isn't extremely so. It's not neutral because it does mention both flaws and strengths, but the emphasis seems to be on the positives. Therefore, a score of 3 (positive) makes sense here.\n</think>\n\nThe text acknowledges some flaws but emphasizes positive aspects like humor, heart, and talent. This leans more positive than negative.\n\n3", 3, 3, 25.625348953995854], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase starts with \"However,\" which sometimes indicates a contrast, but in this case, it's introducing a positive aspect of the film. Words like \"completely honest\" and \"open-hearted\" are strong positives. These adjectives suggest that the film is genuine and warm, which are traits people usually appreciate.\n\nNext, the text says the film should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it. While \"succumb\" might sound a bit negative at first glance, in this context, it probably means letting go of reservations or fully experiencing the film's emotions. So, it's encouraging viewers to engage with the film deeply, which is a positive endorsement.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment seems positive. There are no negative words here; instead, there's praise for honesty and an open heart, along with encouragement to enjoy the film. The overall tone is appreciative and favorable.\n\nI think the sentiment leans towards very positive because of the strong adjectives used and the encouraging language. It's not just neutral or slightly positive; it's highlighting commendable qualities in a way that suggests enthusiasm.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 4, 30.0133204080048], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It mentions two things about people: their capacity for evil and their capacity for good. \"Devastating testimony\" is used for both, which might seem conflicting at first glance.\n\nThe word \"devastating\" typically has a negative connotation. So when it's paired with \"capacity for evil,\" that part definitely sounds negative. But then it also says \"heroic capacity for good,\" which flips things around because \"heroic\" is positive. \n\nSo the sentence is balancing both extremes of human nature\u2014evil and good. It's highlighting that people are capable of both, but in a way that shows the depth of each aspect. The use of \"devastating testimony\" might make it seem more negative at first, but pairing it with the heroic side adds a layer of positivity.\n\nI'm thinking about how sentiment analysis works. Usually, positive and negative words contribute to the overall score. Here, both aspects are presented equally. So maybe the sentence isn't leaning heavily in one direction. It's showing duality rather than expressing a clear positive or negative emotion.\n\nAlso, the structure of the sentence is neutral\u2014it's presenting facts about human capacities without a strong emotional charge beyond stating their capabilities. The balance between evil and good might lead to a neutral sentiment because it's not encouraging either side but just stating they exist.\n\nI should consider if any words carry more weight. \"Devastating\" could make the negative part stronger, but since it's balanced with the positive, perhaps it evens out. Alternatively, maybe the mention of both extremes leads to a more contemplative or neutral sentiment rather than purely positive or negative.\n\nSo putting it all together, even though there are elements that could be seen as negative and positive, the overall tone seems balanced. The sentence doesn't express a strong preference for one over the other but instead presents them as coexisting aspects of humanity.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 3, 45.93155052300426], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me read through the text again carefully.\n\nThe sentence is: \"At the one-hour mark, Herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down each part. The first part mentions that at the one-hour mark, Herzog (presumably the director) runs out of ideas. \"Runs out of ideas\" sounds negative because it suggests a lack of creativity or direction in the film.\n\nNext, the pace becomes \"positively leaden.\" Wait, \"positively\" here might be tricky. Normally, \"positive\" is good, but when used with \"leaden,\" which means slow and heavy, it's actually being sarcastic or emphasizing how bad it is. So this part is negative because it's saying the movie drags on in a boring way.\n\nThen, the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion. \"Sputters\" implies that it struggles to end, not smoothly. \"Inevitable tragic conclusion\" suggests that the ending was unavoidable and sad, which could be seen as either negative or neutral depending on context. However, given the previous parts, it's contributing to a negative sentiment.\n\nPutting it all together, the text is criticizing the movie for losing creativity, becoming slow and boring, and having an inevitable sad end. These are all negative points about the film's quality and pacing.\n\nSo, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, which might be too extreme here since the criticism isn't extremely harsh. The sentence doesn't use super strong words like \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" It's more of a moderate negative sentiment. Therefore, I think it falls under 1 (negative).\n</think>\n\nThe text criticizes the movie for losing creativity and having a slow pace, indicating a negative sentiment.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 0, 41.191745288990205], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence provided is: \"... about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the phrase \"about as exciting\" suggests that whatever is being compared isn't very exciting at all. So the comparison is to two last-place basketball teams. Last place means they're probably not good players or maybe have a losing record. Basketball games between bad teams can be boring because there's less competition and excitement.\n\nThen, it says \"on the final day of the season.\" That might mean it's towards the end, so maybe there's no real stakes left, making the game even more lackluster. People often don't care as much about the last games because they know their team isn't going to make it further, so it's just a formality.\n\nPutting it all together, the text is comparing something (maybe another event or situation) to a basketball game that's not exciting. The use of \"as exciting\" with negative connotations towards the teams and the timing suggests that whatever is being compared isn't engaging or thrilling. So the sentiment here is negative because it's pointing out a lack of excitement, which is a downer.\n\nNow, considering the scale from 0 to 4: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, etc. This seems like a solid negative statement but not extremely so. It's more about being unexciting rather than something truly awful or devastating. So maybe it's a 1 on the scale because it conveys negativity but isn't overly harsh.\n</think>\n\n1", 1, 0, 31.59478919301182], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The script is described as \"canny\" which means clever or resourceful, that's positive. \"Meditative\" suggests thoughtful or reflective, also a neutral to positive term.\n\nThen it says the script distances sex and love. Distance here might mean exploring them separately, not necessarily negative. Then it mentions Byron and Luther realizing they can't get satisfaction without love. So love is essential for satisfaction, which seems positive.\n\nThe overall tone isn't overly emotional or negative. It's more about themes in a script rather than expressing strong feelings. There's no explicit negative words except \"can't get no satisfaction,\" but that's part of the narrative and shows a realization leading to understanding the importance of love.\n\nSo considering all, it's neutral with slightly positive elements, so probably 2 or maybe 3. Since it's more about themes than expressing emotion directly, I'll go with 2, neutral.\n</think>\n\nThe text discusses themes in a script without strong emotional language, focusing on the necessity of love for satisfaction.

It starts with \"inventive\" which usually has a positive connotation because it suggests creativity. Then \"absorbing,\" which also sounds positive\u2014it means something that holds your attention well.\n\nThe sentence continues by saying it's hard to classify and hard to resist. Now, being hard to classify might not be entirely negative; it could mean the movie is unique or doesn't fit neatly into one genre, which some people appreciate. Being hard to resist implies that once you start watching, it's difficult to stop, which is a positive trait because it keeps viewers engaged.\n\nPutting it all together: \"inventive\" and \"absorbing\" are strong positive descriptors. The rest of the sentence doesn't introduce any negative words; instead, it emphasizes the movie's uniqueness and engaging nature. \n\nI don't see any negative terms here. All adjectives used are favorable. So the sentiment should be quite positive. Now, looking at the scale: 0 is very negative, 4 is very positive.

Words like \"slick\" and \"sprightly\" are positive descriptors. Slick can mean smooth or impressive, while sprightly suggests lively and energetic. These indicate a positive view of the CGI feature.\n\nNext, the phrase \"sufficiently funny\" stands out. It means the content is amusing enough to entertain people, which is another positive point. The target audience here includes even parents who are unreligious, but they still find it amusing. This shows that the feature has broad appeal beyond just religious viewers.\n\nThe sentence structure also suggests approval. Using \"even\" emphasizes that the humor reaches a group that might be less inclined to enjoy it otherwise, which is a compliment. The word \"amuse\" conveys that it's entertaining and enjoyable, adding to the positive sentiment.\n\nThere are no negative words or phrases in this text.

Let me read the sentence again: \"What goes on for the 110 minutes of `` panic room '' is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals.\"\n\nAlright, first I'll break down the words used here. The phrase \"battle of witlessness\" immediately stands out to me. \"Witlessness\" means lacking intelligence or common sense, so that's negative. Then it describes the characters as \"not-so-bright,\" which is another negative term, and the criminals are called \"even less capable.\" So both sets of people involved are being criticized for their lack of smarts.\n\nThe structure of the sentence seems to be comparing how the movie unfolds over 110 minutes, but instead of highlighting any positive aspects, it's focusing on how the characters aren't smart. The use of \"not-so-bright\" and \"even less capable\" implies that both the mother-daughter duo and the criminals are unintelligent. This makes the situation seem like a competition where everyone is equally inept.\n\nI don't see any positive words here. There's no mention of exciting plot points, good acting, or anything redeeming about the movie. Instead, it's all about how the characters lack wit and capability. So the overall tone is critical and negative.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The text is clearly expressing a negative sentiment. How strong is that negativity? It's pretty harsh\u2014calling both sides witless and less capable.

Wait, no: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative. The sentence is definitely negative, but does it reach \"very negative\"? The language isn't extremely harsh; it's more of a critique than an enraged statement.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider the intensity.

So perhaps it's moderately negative rather than very negative. Therefore, 1 might be appropriate here.\n</think>\n\nThe text is critical of the characters' intelligence, using terms like \"witlessness,\" \"not-so-bright,\" and \"less capable.\" This conveys a negative sentiment without extreme harshness.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 58.94019025401212], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

That could be positive or neutral depending on what's said next. Then it says that the new movie \"hasn't escaped the rut dug by the last one.\" The phrase \"rut\" usually has a negative connotation, implying stagnation or lack of progress. So the review is pointing out that this new installment isn't breaking away from the previous one's issues.\n\nPutting that together, the sentiment seems negative because it suggests the movie doesn't improve on the previous one and fails to meet expectations for better storytelling. But how strong is this negativity? The words used aren't extremely harsh; it's more of a disappointment than outright anger or disgust. \n\nSo I think the sentiment is negative but not extremely so.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at each word. \"Disjointed\" means something that's disconnected or not coherent. It can imply confusion or lack of organization, which might lean towards negative because it suggests something isn't well put together. On the other hand, \"parody\" refers to a humorous imitation of something, usually meant for comic effect. Parodies are typically positive in intent, aiming to mock or satirize.\n\nNow, considering both words together: a \"disjointed parody\" could mean that the parody is chaotic or not well-structured. While parodies themselves are often intended to be funny, if they're disjointed, it might mean they aren't effective. Alternatively, maybe the disjointedness adds to the humor in an unexpected way.\n\nI should consider the context where such a phrase might be used. If someone describes something as a \"disjointed parody,\" they could be criticizing its lack of coherence, which would lean negative. But without more context, it's hard to say definitively. Maybe the person is pointing out that while it's meant to be funny, it doesn't come together well, making it less impactful.\n\nI also think about how each word contributes. \"Disjointed\" is neutral to slightly negative, while \"parody\" is neutral with a positive connotation if successful. Combining them might result in an overall neutral sentiment because the criticism isn't overly harsh\u2014it's more of an observation than a strong negative or positive statement.\n\nSo putting it all together, I think the sentiment is neutral. It doesn't express strong negativity or positivity but rather points out that the parody lacks coherence.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 1, 36.740931400010595], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me read through the text carefully.\n\nThe sentence is about a film directed by Hawke, and it says the film is \"a boring, pretentious waste of nearly two hours.\" That sounds pretty harsh. The words \"boring\" and \"pretentious\" are definitely negative adjectives. Then it goes on to say that the film doesn't tell you anything except that the Chelsea Hotel is populated by \"whiny, pathetic, starving, and untalented artistes.\" All these descriptors\u2014whiny, pathetic, starving, untalented\u2014are strong negatives.\n\nSo breaking this down: The user uses multiple negative words both about the film itself and about the people in it. They are clearly expressing dissatisfaction and a low opinion of both the film and its subject matter. There's no positive language here at all; everything is critical and dismissive.\n\nI don't see any neutral or positive elements to balance this out. The sentiment is entirely negative, and given the intensity of the words used, it's more than just slightly negative.

The phrase mentions \"primal storytelling,\" which suggests a raw and fundamental form of narrative. It's comparing someone else's storytelling ability to George Lucas, the renowned filmmaker known for creating Star Wars. By saying \"can only dream of,\" it implies that George Lucas doesn't possess this level of storytelling himself.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n- \"Primal storytelling\" is a compliment because it refers to a basic, powerful form of narrative.\n- Comparing someone else's ability to George Lucas (a respected figure) positively highlights their skill.\n- The structure of the sentence suggests admiration and high regard for the storytelling in question.\n\nNow, considering sentiment scores:\n0: Very negative - Doesn't fit here as there are no negative words or context.\n1: Negative - Also doesn't apply since the tone is positive.\n2: Neutral - It's not neutral because the statement clearly praises the storytelling.\n3: Positive - This could be a possible score as it's complimentary.\n4: Very positive - The use of \"can only dream of\" suggests an exceptionally high regard, which leans towards very positive.\n\nThe phrase doesn't just say something is good; it implies that even someone as accomplished as George Lucas can't reach this level. That's a strong endorsement, making the sentiment very positive rather than just positive.\n\nI should also consider if there's any sarcasm or irony, but nothing in the sentence suggests that. It seems genuine praise.\n</think>\n\nThe statement praises the storytelling highly, comparing it to something even George Lucas couldn't achieve, which indicates a very positive sentiment.\n\n4", 4, 3, 39.83329136899556], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

So I guess I need to look for such indicators in any given text.\n\nNow, the task is to take a piece of text, assess its sentiment, and assign it an integer from 0 to 4. Each number represents the level of negativity or positivity: 0 being very negative, up to 4 as very positive.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, first, I should probably break down the text into individual words and analyze their connotations. Words like \"amazing,\" \"fantastic,\" \"wonderful\" are clearly positive. Conversely, words like \"terrible,\" \"awful,\" \"disappointing\" would be negative.\n\nBut sometimes, it's not just about individual words. The context matters too. For example, if the text says something like \"The service was okay, but I expected better.\" Here, \"okay\" is neutral, but the second part introduces a negative sentiment. So I need to consider both aspects and maybe average them or give more weight to the stronger sentiment.\n\nI should also think about the structure of sentences. If the text uses superlatives or intensifiers like \"extremely,\" \"incredibly,\" that would push it towards higher positivity or negativity. Also, exclamation marks can indicate a stronger emotion, but in written text without punctuation, I might not have that clue.\n\nAnother consideration is the length and complexity of the text. Longer texts with more descriptive language might give a clearer picture. However, if the text is short, like a tweet, I need to be careful not to overinterpret from limited words.\n\nLet me think about possible steps:\n1. **Identify Key Words**: Look for adjectives and adverbs that carry strong positive or negative meanings.\n2. **Assess Context**: Consider how these words are used within the sentence. For example, \"not bad\" is a mixed signal but leans towards neutral to slightly positive.\n3. **Evaluate Intensity**: Determine if there are intensifiers that make the sentiment stronger.\n4. **Consider Sentence Structure**: Sometimes, sentences with multiple positive or negative elements can skew the overall sentiment.\n5. **Check for Irony or Sarcasm**: This can be tricky as it might invert the sentiment, but without context, it's hard to detect.\n\nWait, but in this task, I'm only supposed to output a number from 0 to 4 based on the text provided. So perhaps I don't need to handle sarcasm unless it's very clear.\n\nLet me think about some examples beyond the one given:\n\n- \"I loved the movie; it was amazing!\" \u2192 This would likely be a 4.\n- \"The food was terrible and left me sick.\" \u2192 This should be a 0.\n- \"It's okay, I guess. Nothing special.\" \u2192 Maybe a 2 or 1, depending on emphasis.\n\nAnother point is that sometimes words can have both positive and negative connotations, but in the context of their sentence, they might lean one way more than the other. For example, \"The service was prompt but the staff seemed unfriendly.\" Here, prompt is positive, but unfriendly is negative. So I need to balance these.\n\nAlso, sometimes the sentiment can be neutral if there's no clear positive or negative words. Like a factual statement without emotion: \"The meeting took place at 3 PM.\" That would be a 2.\n\nI should also consider that some texts might express mixed sentiments but lean towards one side. For instance, \"While the plot was engaging, the pacing felt too slow.\" Here, \"engaging\" is positive, and \"too slow\" is negative. I have to decide which sentiment is stronger or if they cancel out into a neutral.\n\nIn cases where there are more positive words than negative, it might be 3. If the negatives outweigh, perhaps a 1. If balanced, then 2.\n\nAnother consideration is the use of comparative words like \"better,\" \"worse.\" For example, \"This product is better than others I've tried.\" This would be positive because it's making a favorable comparison. Conversely, \"Worse service ever!\" would be very negative.\n\nI should also think about idioms or phrases that carry specific sentiments without explicit adjectives. Like \"That was the best day ever!\" which is clearly very positive.\n\nWhat about negations? For example, \"Not bad\" is a bit tricky because it's a double negative meaning good. So in such cases, I need to parse the sentence structure correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of emotional words like \"hate,\" \"love,\" \"disgusted,\" \"delighted\" are strong indicators. Words like \"like\" or \"dislike\" might be less intense but still contribute to sentiment.\n\nSo, summarizing my approach:\n1. **Tokenize the text** into individual words and phrases.\n2. **Identify sentiment-bearing words**, focusing on adjectives, adverbs, and emotional verbs.\n3. **Assign a score** to each word based on its positivity or negativity.\n4. **Sum the scores** to get an overall sentiment score.\n5. **Normalize the score** to fit into the 0-4 scale.\n\nBut how do I assign numerical values? Maybe using a predefined lexicon where each word has a known sentiment value, like +1 for positive, -1 for negative, and 0 otherwise. Then, summing these up and normalizing based on the number of words.\n\nWait, but that might not account for intensity. For example, \"excellent\" is stronger than \"good.\" So perhaps each word has a weight. If I don't have such weights, maybe I can default to +1 or -1 per word, then adjust based on intensifiers like \"very,\" \"extremely.\"\n\nAlternatively, I could use an average of the scores divided by the number of words, but that might not capture nuances.\n\nAnother approach is to look for positive and negative markers. Each positive word adds to a positive count, each negative subtracts, and then the total determines the sentiment. For example:\n\nPositive words: 3\nNegative words: 1\n\nTotal = (3 - 1) / (3 + 1) \u2192 0.5 on a scale from -1 to +1. Then map that to 0-4.\n\nBut this might not capture the intensity properly. Maybe using an algorithm like VADER, which considers both the presence of sentiment words and their intensity modifiers.\n\nHowever, since I'm supposed to do this manually without external libraries, perhaps I can create a simple scoring system where each positive word is +1, negative is -1, and then map the total score accordingly.\n\nFor example:\n- Total score = (number of positives) - (number of negatives)\n- Then scale that to 0-4 based on the possible range. The maximum number of words in a text would determine the scaling factor.\n\nBut without knowing the text length beforehand, this might be challenging. Alternatively, just take the total score and normalize it into 0-4 based on predefined ranges.\n\nWait, but let's think about how the example given was classified as 4. The text had two strong positive adjectives: \"brilliantly\" and \"intelligently.\" So perhaps each of those is worth more than a simple +1. Maybe they are worth +2 each, so total is +4.\n\nBut without knowing the exact weights, this becomes subjective. Alternatively, if I consider that each strongly positive word contributes to a higher score, making it 4.\n\nSo perhaps the process is:\n\n- Look for strongly positive words (amazing, brilliant, excellent) \u2192 add 1 point each.\n- Neutral words don't affect.\n- Strongly negative words subtract points.\n\nThen scale accordingly. But this requires knowing which words are considered strong in either direction.\n\nIn any case, I think for this task, the key is to identify the sentiment words and their intensity, sum them up, and then assign a score from 0 to 4 based on that total.\n\nLet me test this with another example:\n\nText: \"The movie was okay. Not great, but not bad either.\"\n\nHere, \"okay\" is neutral (2), \"not great\" has a slightly negative connotation (-1?), \"not bad\" is positive (+1). So overall, it's neutral to slightly positive.\n\nSo perhaps the score would be 2 or maybe 3 if leaning towards positive.\n\nBut without knowing the exact weights, this is tricky. Maybe I should default to considering each sentiment word as +1 or -1 and calculate accordingly.\n\nIn the original example: two strong positives \u2192 total of +2. The scale from 0-4, so perhaps mapping a higher total to 4.\n\nAlternatively, if a text has three positive words, that's more than enough for a 4.\n\nWait, but in reality, people often use multiple positive adjectives without necessarily intending the maximum positivity. So maybe each strong positive word adds +1 up to a maximum of 4.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think in terms of how the sentiment is perceived rather than strictly counting words. For example:\n\n- \"I loved the movie!\" \u2192 very positive (4)\n- \"It was good.\" \u2192 moderately positive (3)\n- \"Okay, I guess.\" \u2192 neutral or slightly positive (2)\n- \"Not great.\" \u2192 slightly negative (1)\n- \"Terrible experience.\" \u2192 very negative (0)\n\nBut this is more of a subjective assessment rather than an algorithmic one.\n\nIn conclusion, to classify the sentiment into 0-4:\n\n1. Identify all words in the text that carry positive or negative sentiment.\n2. Assign each word a value based on its intensity: strong positive (+2), weak positive (+1), neutral (0), weak negative (-1), strong negative (-2).\n3. Sum these values to get a total score.\n4. Map this total score into the 0-4 scale, where higher scores correspond to more positive sentiments and lower to negative.\n\nFor example:\n\nTotal score: +4 \u2192 4\nTotal score: +2 \u2192 3\nTotal score: 0 \u2192 2\nTotal score: -2 \u21921\nTotal score: -4 \u21920\n\nBut I need to be cautious with scaling because the number of words varies. Maybe it's better to calculate an average.\n\nAlternatively, use a threshold-based approach:\n\n- If total positive > negative and strong positives present \u21924\n- If mostly positive but some negatives \u21923\n- Balanced or slightly positive \u21922\n- Mostly negative with some positives\u21921\n- Very negative\u21920\n\nBut this is more heuristic and might not cover all cases.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can structure my analysis as follows:\n\nFor any given text:\n\na) Split the text into words.\nb) For each word, determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. Assign scores accordingly.\nc) Sum all scores.\nd) Determine where this sum falls on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, I'll need to make judgment calls based on the words used.\n\nNow, considering that, let's try to apply this to a sample text:\n\nText: \"The service was terrible and slow. I would never come back.\"\n\nSentiment words:\n- terrible (strong negative, -2)\n- slow (weak negative, -1)\n- never come back (strong negative implication, maybe -2)\n\nTotal score: (-2) + (-1) + (-2) = -5\n\nBut since our scale is 0-4, we need to map this. Maybe the maximum possible negative sum determines 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps normalize such that:\n\n- Max positive total \u21924\n- Min negative total\u21920\n- Midpoint (neutral)\u21922\n\nSo if the total can range from -N to +N, then (Total + N)/(2N)*4 would scale it into 0-4. But without knowing N in advance, this is hard.\n\nAlternatively, use a fixed mapping:\n\nIf the text has predominantly strong positive words \u21924\nPredominantly negative\u21920\nMixed but more positive\u21923 or 2\nMixed but more negative\u21921 or 2\n\nIn any case, for the purpose of this task, I'll proceed by evaluating each word's sentiment and intensity, summing them up, and then mapping to 0-4 accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the sentiment of a given text on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Sentiment Words**: Look for words that carry positive or negative connotations. Examples include \"amazing\" (positive), \"terrible\" (negative).\n\n2. **Assign Scores**: \n   - Strong positive (+2): excellent, amazing\n   - Weak positive (+1): good, okay\n   - Neutral (0)\n   - Weak negative (-1): bad, slow\n   - Strong negative (-2): terrible, hate\n\n3. **Calculate Total Score**: Sum the scores of all sentiment words.\n\n4. **Map to 0-4 Scale**:\n   - If the total is high and positive \u2192 4\n   - Mixed but more positive \u2192 3 or 2\n   - Neutral or balanced \u2192 2\n   - Mixed but more negative \u21921 or 2\n   - High negative \u21920\n\n**Example Analysis:**\n\nText: \"The service was terrible and slow. I would never come back.\"\n\n- Sentiment words: \"terrible\" (-2), \"slow\" (-1), \"never come back\" (-2)\n- Total score: (-2) + (-1) + (-2) = -5\n- Mapping: Since the score is highly negative, it maps to 0.\n\n**Answer:** The sentiment of the text is rated as \\boxed{0}.", 0, 4, 305.03936615400016], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user provided a sentence and wants it classified on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). \n\nFirst, I'll read the text carefully: \"it's the type of stunt the academy loves: a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film.\" Hmm, so there are two parts here. The first part talks about it being a \"stunt\" that the Academy loves, which might have a slightly negative connotation because stunts can sometimes be seen as gimmicks rather than genuine artistry.\n\nThe second part mentions a \"powerful political message\" but describes the film itself as \"otherwise mediocre.\" That seems like a mixed bag. On one hand, the political message is strong, which could be positive or neutral depending on context, but the film's mediocrity leans negative.\n\nI need to weigh these elements. The term \"mediocre\" definitely carries a negative sentiment about the overall quality of the film despite the political aspect. However, it doesn't sound extremely harsh\u2014more like a lukewarm or slightly negative review rather than outright hostile. So putting this together, I think the sentiment isn't very positive but also not extremely negative. It's more on the neutral to slightly negative side.\n\nLooking at the scale: 0 is very negative, which might be too strong here. 1 is negative, but does it capture the slight negativity without being too harsh? Alternatively, maybe it's closer to neutral because of the mixed elements. But since the film is called \"mediocre,\" I think that leans it towards slightly negative.\n\nSo I'm leaning towards classifying this as a 1 (negative) because while there are positive aspects mentioned (the political message), the overall assessment of the film being mediocre makes the sentiment negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text describes a film with a strong political message but criticizes its mediocrity, indicating a slightly negative sentiment.\n\n1", 1, 2, 40.26273726098589], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text provided is: \"the production values are of the highest and the performances attractive without being memorable.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down each part of the sentence to understand the sentiment expressed. Let's look at each component:\n\n1. \"The production values are of the highest\" \u2013 This seems like a strong positive statement. Production values refer to the quality of elements like lighting, sound, set design, etc., in a film or show. Saying they're \"of the highest\" is definitely a compliment.\n\n2. \"and the performances attractive without being memorable.\" \u2013 Here, there are two parts: \"performances attractive\" and \"without being memorable.\" The first part is positive because saying something is attractive usually means it's visually pleasing or has good appeal. However, the second part says they aren't memorable, which could be a slight negative or neutral depending on context. Memorable can imply that they left a lasting impression, so not being memorable might mean they didn't make as big an impact.\n\nPutting these together: The first part is strongly positive, while the second part is somewhat mixed. It's positive in saying performances are attractive but tempered by them not being memorable. So it's not entirely negative because there's still praise for the attractiveness of the performances.\n\nNow, I need to decide if the overall sentiment leans more towards positive or neutral. The production values being high is a significant plus, and while the performances aren't unforgettable, they are still described as attractive. There isn't any overtly negative language beyond saying they're not memorable. So the sentiment seems to be on the positive side but maybe not extremely so.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 (very negative) doesn't fit because there's no strong negative words. 1 is negative; again, not quite because there are positives mentioned. 2 is neutral, which could be possible if the positives and negatives balance out, but I think the positive aspects of high production values and attractive performances might tip it towards a positive sentiment. However, since the performances aren't memorable, maybe it's just slightly positive rather than very positive.\n\nSo, perhaps the sentiment is positive but not extremely so, which would correspond to 3. Alternatively, if the not being memorable is more impactful, it could be neutral at 2. But given that both parts are somewhat positive (high production values and attractive performances), I think it's leaning towards positive.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 3, 49.20960036799079], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

In this case, it might mean that the movie doesn't let up but not necessarily in a good way. \"Bombastic\" is definitely negative; it implies something overly dramatic or exaggerated in a bad way. \"Ultimately empty\" is clearly negative because it suggests the film lacks substance or meaning.\n\nPutting it all together, the text seems to be criticizing the movie as being intense and over-the-top but lacking depth. The adjectives used are mostly negative.

It could go either way depending on context. Then there's \"misfire,\" which typically has a negative meaning\u2014it suggests something went wrong or didn't work as intended.\n\nPutting those two together, \"peculiar misfire\" sounds like something unexpected and unsuccessful. The phrase continues with \"that even Tunney can't save.\" I'm not sure who Tunney is, but it seems like someone important enough that their inability to fix the situation emphasizes how bad things are. So, if even Tunney can't save it, the situation must be quite negative.\n\nSo overall, the sentiment here is negative because of \"misfire\" and the implication that no one can fix it.

Then, it says the viewer roots for Gai's character, which means they're hoping she succeeds or avoids a bad outcome. The fate that has befallen others implies previous Carmens had negative outcomes, so rooting against that adds to the positivity.\n\nPutting this together, the sentiment is clearly positive.

It starts with \"pleasant,\" which has a positive connotation. That suggests that whatever is being described has some good qualities. So that's a point in favor of a positive sentiment.\n\nHowever, the second part says \"but not more than recycled jock piffle.\" Now, I need to parse this phrase. \"Recycled\" implies something that's been done before and maybe isn't original or fresh. \"Jock piffle\" sounds like it's referring to jargon or talk from a sports context that might be considered trivial or overused. So putting it together, the person is saying that while the thing they're describing is pleasant, it doesn't offer anything new or substantial beyond what's already been seen before in similar contexts.\n\nSo overall, there are two parts: a positive aspect (\"pleasant\") and a criticism about lack of originality and substance (\"recycled jock piffle\"). The sentiment isn't entirely negative because the first word is positive. But it's also not very positive because the latter part downplays that positivity by indicating it's just more of the same, which might be seen as underwhelming.\n\nI think this leans towards neutral.

So that part is definitely a positive sentiment.\n\nThen there's the second part: \"but does n't generate a lot of tension.\" This seems to be pointing out a lack of tension, which might not be a bad thing depending on context, but in this case, since it's following a positive statement, it could indicate a slight negative or at least a neutral point. The use of the word \"doesn't\" suggests something is missing that perhaps was expected.\n\nPutting them together, the sentence starts with a strong positive and then follows up with a mild criticism or observation. So overall, I'm thinking it's not extremely positive because there's a but involved. It doesn't outright say it's bad, just that there's a lack in tension. \n\nI need to decide where this falls on the scale. Since it starts very positively but has a negative point, maybe it averages out to neutral or slightly positive? But considering the structure, \"very well made\" is quite strong, so perhaps the sentiment isn't too low.\n\nWait, but let's think about how sentiment scores are usually calculated. If there's a mix of positive and negative elements, sometimes the score reflects a balance. Here, it's one strong positive and a moderate negative. So maybe it doesn't go all the way to 2 (neutral) because of the initial positive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more on the positive side because the first part is stronger. But I'm not sure if \"doesn't generate tension\" is a significant enough negative to bring the score down. In some contexts, lack of tension might be a plus, but here it seems like the person expected tension and didn't get it.\n\nSo maybe the sentiment is 2 (neutral) because the positives and negatives somewhat balance each other out.

The second part doesn't necessarily make it negative; it just points out a lack. So maybe the overall sentiment isn't negative, just not extremely positive. Maybe it's neutral because one part is strong positive and another is a bit underwhelming but not negative.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because sometimes in sentiment analysis, the presence of both positive and negative words can lead to a more moderate score. Since \"very well made\" is quite positive, maybe it tilts towards 3 (positive), but considering the criticism, perhaps it's just neutral.\n\nAlternatively, if the system interprets the overall message as still being positive despite the caveat, then 2 might be too low. Maybe 3?

Fresh implies something new and exciting, which is a good sign. Entertaining means it's enjoyable to watch or participate in, so that's another positive point.\n\nThen there's the phrase \"minus traditional gender roles.\" This part is interesting because it could be interpreted in different ways depending on context. On one hand, removing traditional gender roles might be seen as progressive and inclusive, which some people view positively. On the other hand, if someone prefers traditional roles, they might see this negatively.

The text provided is: \"the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the sentence. It's talking about \"The Country Bears,\" which I assume is a movie or show. The key part here is \"has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers.\" This means that the content is safe for children and won't contain anything distressing.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment, this statement seems positive because it highlights that the content is suitable and not harmful to young audiences. However, I should assess how strong this positivity is. The phrase doesn't overly praise the show; instead, it states a factual benefit regarding child safety. \n\nSo, on the scale of 0 to 4, where 2 is neutral, 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive. Since the statement isn't extremely enthusiastic but does present a clear advantage, I think it's more than neutral but not extremely positive. Therefore, I'll classify this as a 3.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is positive because it highlights that \"The Country Bears\" doesn't contain scenes that might upset young viewers, indicating suitability for children.\n\n3", 3, 2, 26.19157880701823], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The first part says that someone is equally happy listening to movies as watching them. That sounds positive because it's about enjoyment in both forms.\n\nNext, the second part mentions the \"slow parade of human frailty.\" Hmm, \"human frailty\" refers to weaknesses or vulnerabilities, which can be seen as negative traits. However, the text says this fascinates the person. Fascination is a positive emotion, even if it's about something that might seem negative on the surface.\n\nSo putting it together, both parts are talking about things that bring enjoyment and interest. The first part directly expresses happiness, and the second part shows fascination with human frailty, which is presented in an intriguing way rather than a condemnable one.\n\nI don't see any overtly negative words here. Words like \"happy\" and \"fascinates\" are positive indicators. There's no sarcasm or hidden negativity that I can detect either. The overall tone seems to be encouraging the person to appreciate these aspects, which leans towards positivity.\n\nTherefore, considering both parts contribute positively, the sentiment should be on the higher end of the scale.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the sentence separately. The first part is \"Lawrence plumbs personal tragedy.\" Plumb here means to explore thoroughly or deeply. Personal tragedy suggests something sad or difficult happening in Lawrence's life. So that seems negative because tragedy is generally a bad thing.\n\nThen the second part is \"and also the human comedy.\" Human comedy refers to humorous aspects of human behavior. Comedy is positive, so this part adds a lighter element. Now, putting these together, the sentence talks about both personal tragedy and human comedy. That means there's a mix of negative and positive elements.\n\nI need to decide how much weight each part carries. The word \"also\" suggests that both aspects are being discussed equally. So it's not just focusing on the tragedy but also including the comedy. This balance might lean towards neutral because it's covering both sides without emphasizing one more than the other.\n\nIf I think about sentiment scoring, negative words like \"tragedy\" would lower the score, while positive words like \"comedy\" would raise it. Since they're balanced here, it doesn't swing too far in either direction. So, a neutral sentiment seems appropriate.\n\nI don't think it's very negative because there's an equal mention of something positive. Similarly, it's not very positive because the tragedy is significant enough to be mentioned alongside comedy. Neutral (2) feels like the right choice here.\n</think>\n\nThe text discusses both personal tragedy and human comedy, balancing negative and positive elements equally. \n\nOutput: 2", 2, 3, 38.10041425898089], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence is: \"Scherfig has made a movie that will leave you wondering about the characters' lives after the clever credits roll.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the key parts of this sentence. The main subject here is Scherfig's movie. The phrase used to describe it is that it will \"leave you wondering about the characters' lives after the clever credits roll.\"\n\nThe word \"clever\" stands out because it's a positive adjective. It suggests that the credits were well thought out and possibly creative. When the credits are described as clever, it reflects positively on the overall movie.\n\nAlso, the fact that the movie leaves viewers wondering about the characters' lives after the credits implies that the story was engaging enough to make people think about what happens next. This is generally a positive sign because it means the film has depth and keeps the audience invested even after it's over.\n\nSo, putting this together, the sentiment expressed here is positive. The use of \"clever\" for the credits and the lingering curiosity about the characters both indicate satisfaction with the movie. There are no negative words or implications in the sentence, so I don't think it leans towards neutral either; it's clearly on the positive side.\n\nNow, looking at the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. The sentiment here isn't extremely positive with superlatives or enthusiastic language, but it's definitely a positive assessment.

Then it says \"you have to give the audience a reason.\" The word \"have to\" can sometimes sound obligatory or a bit negative, but in this context, it might be neutral. The rest of the sentence is about making the audience want to put forth effort. That seems positive because it's about motivating others.\n\nThe main idea here is emphasizing the importance of providing motivation, which is constructive and positive. So I think the sentiment isn't extremely positive (4), but it's definitely leaning more towards a positive outlook.

It's talking about Mr. Koshashvili being a director that someone should watch. The phrase \"a director to watch\" suggests that he's worth paying attention to, which is generally a positive statement.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. Words like \"watch\" in this context imply potential and something to look out for positively. There's no criticism or dissatisfaction mentioned. So it's not neutral because it's giving a specific recommendation about him being notable.\n\nConsidering the intensity, it's more than just a positive statement; it's highlighting that he's someone to keep an eye on, which leans towards a higher positivity level. But is it \"very positive\"? It doesn't use superlatives or overly enthusiastic language, so maybe not 4. \n\nSo balancing between positive and very positive, I think it's more of a 3 because it's clearly positive but without extreme adjectives.\n</think>\n\nThe statement highlights Mr. Koshashvili as someone notable in his role, indicating a positive sentiment.\n\n3", 3, 4, 25.188837538007647], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each word and try to understand their meanings. \"Happily\" is an adverb that generally has a positive connotation\u2014it means in a happy way. Then there's \"glib,\" which usually describes someone who speaks smoothly but insincerely or superficially. That can be seen as somewhat negative because it implies a lack of depth or honesty. The word \"vicious\" definitely has a strong negative meaning; it refers to something cruel, harmful, or aggressive.\n\nSo putting that together: the text is saying that something (probably a story or characters) is both happily glib and vicious. The combination is interesting because \"happily\" adds a positive spin, but \"glib\" and \"vicious\" are negative traits. It's a bit conflicting. \n\nI need to determine whether these adjectives together make the overall sentiment lean more towards positive, neutral, or negative. On one hand, \"happily\" could suggest that despite being glib and vicious, there's a light-hearted or cheerful aspect. But then again, \"glib\" and \"vicious\" are both criticisms. \n\nMaybe it's describing characters who are superficially happy but have underlying cruel traits. That could mean the sentiment isn't extremely negative because of the \"happily,\" but it's still not positive overall. So perhaps it's somewhere in the middle.\n\nLooking at the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. Considering the mixed adjectives, with a slight edge towards negative because \"vicious\" is strong, I think it's not extremely negative but still negative enough to be a 1.\n\nWait, but \"happily glib\" could imply that they're superficially charming without malice, so maybe it's more neutral. Hmm, this is tricky. If \"glib\" doesn't necessarily mean harmful but just smooth or clever in a way that's not deep, then perhaps the sentiment isn't as negative.\n\nI think I'll go with 2 because while there are both positive and negative elements, they balance out to something neutral.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 2, 49.32803886101465], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

This suggests disappointment or frustration.\n\nNext, it mentions following up a \"delightful, well-crafted family film.\" The adjectives here are positive: \"delightful\" and \"well-crafted,\" indicating that the original film was good. However, the issue arises with what comes next\u2014it's followed by something else that isn't as good.\n\nThe sentence ends with \"a computer-generated cold fish.\" Now, \"computer-generated\" could be neutral on its own, but paired with \"cold fish,\" which is a metaphor for someone or something unemotional or unfeeling. In this context, it likely refers to the sequel or follow-up being dull, lifeless, or lacking warmth compared to the original.\n\nPutting it all together, the speaker is expressing dissatisfaction because they expected another good film but got something subpar instead. The use of \"no excuse\" emphasizes that there's no reason for such a letdown after a positive experience. \n\nSo, sentiment-wise, this isn't just a slight negative; it's more on the stronger side. They're not neutral or slightly negative; they're clearly upset about the follow-up being poor. Therefore, I think this falls into either 0 (very negative) or 1 (negative). Since the language is strong but doesn't use extremely harsh words, maybe it's a 1 for negative rather than 0.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed is strongly negative due to disappointment with the follow-up film after a positive experience. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 41.869326393993106], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It says that there's nothing interesting about something called \"unfaithful.\" The word \"nothing\" here implies a complete lack of interest. Using such strong language suggests a negative opinion.\n\nThe phrase \"whatsoever\" is also quite emphatic, reinforcing the negativity. So the speaker is not just saying it's not interesting; they're emphasizing that there's absolutely no interest at all. This makes the sentiment more than just neutral or slightly negative\u2014it's strongly negative.\n\nI should consider if there are any positive words here, but I don't see any. The entire statement is focused on the absence of something good (interest). There's no ambiguity; it's clearly expressing dissatisfaction or a lack of appeal.\n\nSo putting this together, the sentiment isn't just slightly negative\u2014it's quite strong. On the scale provided, 0 is very negative, so I think that's the appropriate classification here.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a strong negative sentiment by stating there's nothing interesting, using emphatic language. \n\n0", 0, 0, 25.564935759990476], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase starts with \"but,\" which can sometimes indicate a contrast or exception, but in this context, it seems more like setting up the situation rather than contradicting something else.\n\nThe main part is about watching the movie and being too interested to care. So, the person is engaged enough that they don't mind other things. The key words here are \"interested\" and \"too...to care.\" Being interested in a movie usually implies a positive experience because interest suggests engagement or enjoyment. \n\nHowever, the phrase \"too interested to care\" might imply that they're so caught up in the movie that they don't notice or worry about other aspects, which could be either neutral or slightly positive. It doesn't necessarily express strong positive emotions but shows that the person is absorbed enough not to mind.\n\nI should consider the overall tone here. There's no explicitly negative word, just a statement about being too engaged. So it's more on the positive side because interest generally signifies a favorable experience. But since it's not overly enthusiastic or using words like \"amazing\" or \"loved,\" it doesn't reach a very high level of positivity.\n\nSo, putting this together: The sentiment is positive but not extremely so. Therefore, I would classify this as 3 on the scale.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence expresses a positive sentiment because the person is engaged enough in the movie to disregard other concerns, indicating enjoyment.

The task is to classify it on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive. Let's break down the sentence given.\n\nThe first part says, \"far too clever by half.\" That phrase usually means someone is overcomplicating things or being overly clever in an annoying way. So that sounds negative right off the bat. \n\nNext, it mentions Howard's film as \"a series of strung-together moments.\" Strung together can imply that the film lacks coherence or flow, like scenes are just put together without a proper structure. That also feels critical.\n\nThen it says, \"with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies, daydreams, memories and one fantastic visual trope after another.\" Okay, so while some of these elements\u2014fantasies, daydreams\u2014are positive descriptors, the way they're used here seems to suggest that the film is full of these elements without much else. The mention of \"one fantastic visual trope after another\" could be a positive point about creativity or visuals, but combined with the earlier negative phrases, it might not be enough to tip the sentiment into positive.\n\nPutting it all together: The text starts with criticism about being too clever and lacking structure, then mentions some positive aspects but in a context that seems more observational than complimentary.

However, the sentiment seems to take a negative turn.\n\nThe phrase \"manages to do virtually everything wrong\" clearly indicates dissatisfaction. The film didn't meet expectations despite its ambitious nature. Then, the comparison of sitting through it to \"an act of cinematic penance\" is strong. Penance implies something unpleasant or torturous that one has to endure for some higher purpose, but it's definitely a negative experience.\n\nPutting this together: While there are a couple of positive adjectives at the beginning, the overall tone is critical and negative. The film's execution is poor despite its intentions, making the sentiment lean towards very negative.

Since one part is definitely positive and the other is a criticism, how does that affect the overall sentiment?\n\nI think the text isn't extremely positive because it points out a flaw. But it's also not very negative because it starts with praise. Maybe it's more on the neutral side?

The criticism about emotional resonance could mean it's not as impactful, but maybe not enough to make the sentiment negative overall.\n\nI'm a bit torn.

Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, looking at the words used: \"flawed\" and \"engrossing.\" Flawed suggests something isn't perfect or has issues, which could lean negative. On the other hand, \"engrossing\" means it's really interesting and holds your attention, which is positive.\n\nSo, the sentence uses both a negative adjective and a positive one. It starts with a flaw but then balances it with being engrossing. This makes me think the overall sentiment isn't purely negative or positive. \n\nThe structure also matters. The word \"but\" is connecting these two adjectives. So, maybe the focus is more on the positive aspect because it's presented after the negative. It could mean that despite some flaws, the thriller is still engaging.\n\nI should consider how strong each adjective is. Flawed isn't extremely harsh; it's just pointing out imperfection. Engrossing is quite a strong positive term, indicating something compelling. \n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment seems to be neutral leaning towards positive because the positive aspect is highlighted more.

So saying they needed less of that implies dissatisfaction with how flashy something was.\n\nThen, \"a lot more romance\" suggests a desire for something warmer, more emotional or intimate. Romance generally has positive connotations.\n\nSo the sentence is expressing a preference shift: away from something flashy (negative implication) towards something romantic (positive). It's not entirely negative because it's also looking to add something positive. But since they're pointing out that there was too much of the negative aspect, the overall sentiment might lean slightly negative or neutral.\n\nIs this more about making a suggestion than expressing strong emotion? Maybe. The person isn't outright condemning but rather suggesting an improvement.

The sentence is: \"Katz's documentary doesn't have much panache, but with material this rich it doesn't need it.\" Alright, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the phrase \"doesn't have much panache\" \u2013 panache usually means style or flair. So saying it lacks panache could be seen as a negative point. The word \"but\" here is important because it introduces a contrast. After that, it says the material is rich and doesn't need panache because of that richness.\n\nSo, even though there's an initial negative about the lack of style, the second part is quite positive by emphasizing how good the content is. The overall message seems to be that while the documentary might not have a flashy presentation, the content makes up for it, which is a strong endorsement.\n\nPutting this together, I think the sentiment is more on the positive side. It's pointing out a minor weakness but then highlighting significant strengths. So, even though there's a slight negative mention, the overall tone leans towards approval because of how the richness of the material overshadows the lack of panache.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 3, 21.66964050801471], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user has given a sentence: \"just bring on the battle bots , please !\" and wants me to classify its sentiment as one of the integers from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the sentence is expressing. \"Just bring on the battle bots\" sounds like someone is eager or excited about something happening\u2014specifically, wanting battle bots to come. The use of \"please\" adds a polite touch but also emphasizes their eagerness.\n\nI should consider the context. Battle bots could be a show, a competition, or some kind of event. The person seems to be requesting that it starts or continues, which usually indicates a positive sentiment because they're looking forward to it.\n\nLooking at the words used: \"bring on\" is often used in anticipation, like wanting something to happen soon. There's no negative language here; everything points towards excitement and positivity.\n\nNow, considering the scale:\n- 0: Very Negative\n- 1: Negative\n- 2: Neutral\n- 3: Positive\n- 4: Very Positive\n\nThe sentence doesn't express any negativity. It's definitely positive because of the eagerness and the use of \"please.\" Since they're clearly looking forward to it, but not using superlatives like \"extremely excited\" or \"can't wait,\" I think it's a solid positive without being extremely so.\n\nSo, I'll go with 3 for positive.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence expresses a positive sentiment due to the eagerness and excitement conveyed.

But in this context, it doesn't seem negative; instead, it's setting up two scenarios.\n\nThe phrase \"undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures\" uses strong positive words like \"undoubtedly\" and \"pleasures.\" This suggests a very positive sentiment towards Bollywood/Hollywood for those familiar with Bombay musicals.\n\nThen the sentence shifts to mention others who aren't familiar but still have plenty to enjoy. The use of \"plenty\" is another positive term, indicating that even newcomers can find enjoyment. The parenthetical \"-lrb- like me -rrb-\" adds a personal touch, showing that someone without prior knowledge also found it enjoyable.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence talks about providing pleasures for both familiar and unfamiliar audiences, with no negative words present. So, the sentiment is positive but not extremely so. It's more than just neutral because it explicitly mentions enjoyment for everyone involved.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a positive sentiment by highlighting pleasure and plenty of enjoyment for different groups.\n\n3", 3, 3, 30.081413127016276], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text provided is \"it's a very valuable film...\". Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each number represents in terms of sentiment. From the query, it looks like 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. So my task is to assign one of these numbers based on how the text feels.\n\nLooking at the sentence: \"it's a very valuable film...\". The key word here is \"valuable.\" That's definitely a positive adjective. When someone calls something valuable, it usually means they hold it in high esteem or find it worthwhile. So that's pointing towards a positive sentiment.\n\nBut wait, there's an ellipsis at the end of the sentence. Maybe the original text was cut off? Or perhaps it's indicating some hesitation. I should consider if this affects the sentiment. However, since \"very valuable\" is such a strong positive term, any trailing thoughts might not necessarily negate that positivity unless they were explicitly negative, which they aren't here.\n\nSo breaking down the sentence: \"it's\" \u2013 neutral, \"a very valuable film\" \u2013 clearly positive. The structure doesn't have any negative words or context to suggest otherwise. Therefore, it's safe to assume the sentiment is on the positive side.\n\nNow, considering the scale, 3 is positive and 4 is very positive. Since the word \"very\" emphasizes the value, that makes it a stronger positive than just a simple positive. So this should be classified as very positive, which is 4.\n\nI don't think there's any ambiguity here because the language used is straightforward. Even if the ellipsis made me think twice, without further negative context, I can confidently say it's very positive.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 4, 39.70278623900958], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The first part talks about Hollywood having a solid formula, which is positive but not super enthusiastic. Then it says Ice Age \"only improves on it,\" so that's definitely a positive statement. \n\nLooking at the details: \"terrific computer graphics\" \u2013 terrific is very positive. \"Inventive action sequences\" \u2013 inventive is good, shows creativity and originality. \"A droll sense of humor\" \u2013 droll means subtly amusing or wryly humorous, which is also positive.\n\nSo overall, each part of the sentence is adding a positive aspect about Ice Age. They're using strong adjectives like terrific and inventive, which indicate high praise.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. The sentiment is clearly positive. Now, how strong is it? \"Terrific\" is quite strong, so maybe 4 for very positive. But I also need to consider if the entire statement is just strongly positive without being overly enthusiastic beyond that.\n\nWait, the text says Ice Age only improves on Hollywood's formula. So it's not just good but better than a solid formula. That adds more positivity. The use of \"only\" might imply it's better in specific areas but still within the expected framework. However, each point is praised highly, so I think 4 makes sense because all aspects are highlighted as very positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text praises Ice Age with strong positive adjectives and highlights improvements on a solid formula, indicating a very positive sentiment.\n\n4", 4, 4, 38.3023897340172], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let's look at each part:\n\n- \"see it now\": This phrase suggests urgency or importance. It could imply that the viewer should watch something before it changes.\n  \n- \"before the inevitable hollywood remake\": Here, the speaker is talking about a Hollywood remake, which they seem to view as an eventuality (\"inevitable\"). Remakes can sometimes be seen negatively if people feel the original was better or unique.\n\n- \"flattens out all its odd , intriguing wrinkles\": The word \"flattens\" suggests that something will lose its complexity or uniqueness. \"Odd\" and \"intriguing wrinkles\" are positive descriptors, indicating that the original has interesting or peculiar aspects that might be lost in a remake.\n\nPutting it together: The speaker is encouraging someone to watch a movie (or some media) before a Hollywood remake comes out because the remake will likely make it more mainstream or less unique. This implies that the original has qualities worth preserving and that the remake might dilute those qualities.\n\nThe sentiment here seems positive towards the original work but negative about the upcoming remake. However, since the main action is advising to see it now (positive encouragement), I should focus on the overall sentiment of the statement rather than dissecting each part's emotion.\n\nLooking at words like \"see,\" \"inevitable,\" \"flattens,\" \"odd,\" and \"intriguing.\" The use of \"flattens\" is somewhat negative, but it's directed towards the remake, not necessarily the original. The descriptors \"odd\" and \"intriguing\" are positive about the original.\n\nSo the sentiment expressed is more on the positive side because the speaker is recommending watching something while it still has its unique qualities before they're altered or lost in a remake. Therefore, I would classify this as a positive sentiment but not extremely so. It's encouraging without being overly enthusiastic, so maybe a 3 (positive) instead of 4 (very positive). But considering the structure and words used, perhaps leaning more towards neutral? Wait, no, because there's an encouragement to see it now before something happens, which is a positive push.\n\nHmm, but the mention of flattening odd wrinkles could be seen as slightly negative. So overall, maybe a 2 (neutral) isn't accurate because the main point is positive. Alternatively, perhaps a 3 since the advice is positive despite the criticism of the remake.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 2, 58.512105146975955], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

So, the user provided a text: \"-lrb- at least -rrb- moore is a real charmer.\" And they want to know if it's negative or positive on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each number represents. 0 is very negative, which would mean the text has strongly negative feelings. 1 is just negative, maybe a bit softer than 0. 2 is neutral, so no clear sentiment either way. 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive.\n\nLooking at the text, it's referring to \"Moore\" as \"a real charmer.\" The word \"charmer\" usually has a positive connotation. It suggests that Moore is charming, which is generally seen as a good quality. So, right off the bat, this seems positive.\n\nBut wait, there are some parentheses here: \"-lrb- at least -rrb-\". Hmm, I think \"-lrb-\" stands for \"left round bracket\" and \"-rrb-\" for \"right round bracket.\" So it's probably referring to a parenthetical phrase. Maybe the original text was something like \"(at least) Moore is a real charmer.\" That could change the nuance.\n\nSo, if the sentence is \"(at least) Moore is a real charmer,\" the \"at least\" might indicate that while Moore is charming, there are other aspects that aren't so great. But since only this part is provided, it's tricky to gauge the overall sentiment without more context.\n\nBut focusing on what's given: \"Moore is a real charmer.\" This is clearly positive. The phrase \"real charmer\" emphasizes that Moore has a pleasing and attractive personality. There are no negative words here; everything points towards positivity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the sentiment is positive. But how strong is it? Is it just positive (3) or very positive (4)? Since it's an outright compliment without any qualifiers beyond \"at least,\" which in this context might be softening the praise a bit but doesn't negate it.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this as 3 (positive).

First, \"enriched\" suggests that the film benefits from something positive. \"Imaginatively mixed cast\" sounds like a compliment\u2014praising diversity or creativity in casting. Then it mentions Christopher Plummer's performance as Uncle Ralph being the most complexly evil version seen across various adaptations.\n\nSo putting it all together: The text is talking about how the film has a great cast and specifically praises an actor's nuanced performance. There are no negative words here\u2014everything seems positive. \"Enriched,\" \"imaginatively mixed,\" and \"subtlest\" and \"complexly evil\" (in this context, complexity in villainy is a good thing for the character) all contribute to a positive sentiment.\n\nSo on the scale of 0-4, I think it's at least a 3 or 4.

In this context, it's likely adding a positive twist because the surprise is probably a pleasant one. \n\nNext, \"insightful\" is clearly a positive adjective. It means having or showing an ability to understand clearly and deeply. So when someone describes something as insightful, they're complimenting its depth of understanding.\n\nPutting these together, \"surprisingly insightful\" suggests that whatever was being discussed exceeded expectations in terms of insightfulness. This would likely evoke a positive reaction from the person reading it. \n\nI need to rate this on the scale provided: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. Since \"insightful\" is definitely positive, but I'm not sure if it's extremely so or just moderately positive.\n\nConsidering that it's a compliment without any superlatives like \"amazingly\" or \"incredibly,\" which might push it towards a higher score, \"surprisingly insightful\" seems to convey a positive sentiment. However, it might not be the most effusive praise possible.\n\nSo on the scale, 3 represents positive sentiment, and that's where I think this phrase falls.

Let's break it down.\n\nThe phrase \"ripper of a yarn\" catches my attention. I know that \"yarn\" often refers to a story or a tale, so someone is talking about a narrative here. The word \"ripper\" in this context probably isn't referring to something literal like cutting; more likely, it's slang for something excellent or outstanding. So, \"ripper of a yarn\" would mean an excellent story.\n\nNext part: \"i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill.\" Here, the person is saying they personally (I for one) enjoyed something. The phrase \"thrill of the chill\" seems a bit tricky at first. I think it refers to getting a thrilling feeling from being cold or experiencing something chilling in a positive way. Maybe it's about enjoying the excitement or suspense that comes with a chilly environment, like in a horror movie or a thriller.\n\nPutting it together: The person is saying that they had an excellent story (ripper of a yarn) and personally enjoyed the thrill associated with something chill. So overall, this seems to be a positive sentiment because they're expressing enjoyment and appreciation for the experience.\n\nNow, looking at the scale: 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit here. 1 is negative, also not applicable. Neutral (2) might be if it's just factual without emotion, but there's clearly positive language used. Positive would be 3, and very positive would be 4.\n\nThe words \"enjoyed\" and \"ripper\" are strong indicators of positivity. The use of \"for one\" emphasizes their personal enjoyment, making the sentiment more pronounced. So I think it's leaning towards a higher score on the positive side.\n\nI'm wondering if there's any nuance here that might make it not extremely positive. Maybe the word \"chill\" could sometimes have a negative connotation, but in this context, combined with \"thrill,\" it seems like it's being used positively as an exciting element rather than something uncomfortable or bad.\n\nTherefore, considering all these points, the sentiment is definitely positive. It might not be extremely so because while they enjoyed it, there isn't superlatives beyond that.

It's praising the complexity and honesty without using superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"fantastic.\" So maybe a 3 for positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text praises the depth and authenticity of a female friendship, highlighting its superiority over Hollywood portrayals. This is a positive statement.\n\n3", 3, 4, 25.19341650599381], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user provided a sentence: \"I can analyze this movie in three words: thumbs friggin' down.\" They want me to classify it on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive), with integers only.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each number represents. 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. So my task is to assign the correct integer based on the sentiment expressed in the text.\n\nLooking at the sentence, the person is talking about analyzing a movie with three words: \"thumbs friggin' down.\" Thumbs down is a common gesture indicating disapproval or dislike. The word \"friggin'\" adds emphasis and makes it stronger, so this isn't just a mild dislike but more of a strong negative sentiment.\n\nI should consider the context. Movies often receive reviews where people express their opinions. A thumbs down usually means the reviewer didn't like the movie. Adding \"friggin'\" intensifies that feeling, making it more emphatic than just saying \"thumbs down.\" So this isn't neutral or slightly negative; it's quite strongly negative.\n\nI might think about other similar expressions to compare. For example, if someone said \"This movie was terrible,\" that would be very negative (0). If they said \"Not my favorite,\" it could be 1. Here, the use of \"friggin'\" suggests a stronger emotion than just a simple thumbs down, so it's more extreme.\n\nI also need to think about whether there's any ambiguity or mixed feelings here. The sentence doesn't have any positive words or conflicting emotions. It's straightforward in its negativity.\n\nSo putting it all together: the sentiment is clearly negative, and given the emphasis with \"friggin'\", it's not just a little negative but very so. Therefore, the classification should be 0 for very negative.\n</think>\n\n0", 0, 0, 41.21094605801045], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"without intent\" means in this context. When someone says a movie is without intent, they might mean that it lacks purpose or direction. It could imply that the film doesn't have a clear message or that its plot isn't well thought out.\n\nSo, if a movie lacks intent, that's generally not a good thing. People usually expect movies to have some sort of intention, whether it's to entertain, tell a story, or convey a message. If a movie fails in this aspect, the sentiment is likely negative.\n\nNow, considering the scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive), I need to decide where \"without intent\" falls. Since the statement points out a significant flaw in the movie's structure or purpose, it should be on the negative side.\n\nBut how negative exactly? It's not an extremely harsh criticism like calling the movie terrible or awful. Instead, it's pointing out a specific issue\u2014lack of intent. So maybe it's moderately negative rather than extremely so.\n\nOn the scale provided:\n0 - Very Negative\n1 - Negative\n2 - Neutral\n3 - Positive\n4 - Very Positive\n\nGiven that \"without intent\" is a criticism but not an overly harsh one, I think it falls under 1 (Negative). It doesn't express extreme dissatisfaction but does indicate disappointment or criticism.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative because the movie lacks intent, which implies a significant flaw. However, it's not extremely harsh.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 37.51600489899283], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It starts by talking about wanting a \"movie time trip,\" which sounds like enjoying or experiencing a movie. Then it mentions the 1960 version being a \"far smoother ride.\" The word \"smoother\" suggests that this version is better than others, maybe compared to newer ones. So the person is recommending the older version as preferable.\n\nI should consider the adjectives used here. Words like \"smooth\" and \"ride\" are positive in context because they imply an enjoyable experience without hiccups or issues. The phrase \"far smoother\" adds emphasis, indicating a significant improvement over other options.\n\nThere's no negative language here. No complaints or criticism; instead, it's a compliment towards the 1960 version. So the sentiment isn't neutral because it's making a positive comparison. It's also not extremely enthusiastic\u2014more of a moderate positive statement.\n\nPutting it all together, this seems like a positive sentiment but not overly so. The user is happy with the 1960 version and thinks it's better than alternatives.

The main elements here are Meyjes' film being described as provocative and an example of the haphazardness of evil. \"Provocative\" can have different connotations\u2014it could mean it's stimulating thought or causing controversy. In this context, without more information, it's a bit neutral but leaning towards something intense.\n\nThe phrase \"haphazardness of evil\" suggests that evil is chaotic and not well-organized. This could be interpreted in a couple of ways. On one hand, maybe the film shows how randomness can lead to negative outcomes, which might make the sentiment slightly negative because it's talking about evil. On the other hand, by highlighting that evil isn't systematic, perhaps it's trying to show that good can come from chaos or that evil isn't as powerful as it seems, which could be a positive spin.\n\nBut considering the words used\u2014\"provocative\" and \"evil\"\u2014it doesn't seem overly negative. The sentence is more analytical than emotional. It's describing the film's portrayal rather than expressing strong feelings of anger or happiness. So, I'm thinking this isn't extremely negative (0) or positive (4). \n\nNeutral would be 2, but maybe it leans a bit towards positive because it's analyzing the film in an intellectual way without overtly negative language. However, \"evil\" could make it slightly negative. It's a bit tricky. Maybe I should consider the context\u2014if the film is being discussed as thought-provoking, that's usually seen as a good thing, so perhaps leaning towards positive but not extremely.\n\nIn the end, since there are elements that could be seen as neutral or slightly positive, I might lean towards 3 (positive) because discussing the nature of evil in a thoughtful way can be seen as insightful. But I'm not entirely sure if it's negative because \"evil\" is inherently a bad thing. However, without more context, it's safer to say it's somewhat positive or neutral.\n\nWait, maybe another angle: \"haphazardness\" implies that evil isn't intentional but rather random. So the film might be showing that evil isn't as powerful or organized as people think, which could be a positive message because it suggests that chaos can sometimes lead to good outcomes or that evil is not a structured force. That makes me think more towards positive.\n\nSo putting it all together: the sentiment is likely positive but not extremely so, so I'd rate it 3.\n</think>\n\nThe text discusses Meyjes' film as provocative and highlights the chaotic nature of evil. While \"evil\" has negative connotations, the analysis suggests that chaos might lead to good outcomes, offering an insightful perspective.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the text: \"brilliantly written and well-acted , yellow asphalt is an uncompromising film .\" I notice several key words here. The phrase \"brilliantly written\" stands out as a strong positive adjective describing the writing quality. Similarly, \"well-acted\" is another positive term, highlighting the performance aspect.\n\nThe word \"uncompromising\" could be seen in different ways. In this context, it might mean that the film doesn't settle for less and stays true to its vision, which can be a compliment. However, without more context, I have to consider whether it's negative or not. But given the positive adjectives before it, \"uncompromising\" seems to add to the praise rather than being a criticism.\n\nThere are no explicitly negative words in the text. All descriptors used are positive or at least neutral but leaning towards positive. The overall tone is complimentary about both the writing and acting, which suggests a positive sentiment.\n\nSo putting this together, the sentiment expressed here is definitely positive. Given the options, it's more than just slightly positive; the use of strong adjectives like \"brilliantly\" and \"well-acted\" indicates a higher level of positivity. Therefore, the appropriate classification would be 4, which represents very positive.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses strong positive adjectives like \"brilliantly written\" and \"well-acted,\" along with a compliment about being \"uncompromising.\" This indicates a very positive sentiment.\n\n4", 4, 4, 35.32309798398637], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me read the text again: \"Elaborate special effects take centre screen, so that the human story is pushed to one side.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down each part. The first phrase talks about elaborate special effects taking center stage. That sounds positive because it mentions something impressive or well-done in a movie or similar context.\n\nHowever, the second part says the human story is pushed aside. This could be negative if the focus on effects comes at the expense of character development or emotional depth. \n\nSo, while there's praise for the special effects, there's criticism about neglecting the narrative elements that involve humans. The sentiment seems mixed but leans more towards negative because it's pointing out a flaw in how the story is presented.\n\nConsidering the scale, 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive. Since the text highlights both positives and negatives but emphasizes the downside of not focusing on the human aspect, I think it falls into the negative category but isn't extremely so.

The person became \"unintentionally famous,\" which on its own could be neutral or even slightly positive because fame is usually a good thing. However, the context changes things. They're being famous for something unpleasant: feeling queasy-stomached, staggering out of the theater, and blacking out in the lobby.\n\nSo, \"queasy-stomached\" suggests they felt sick, which is negative. \"Staggered\" implies instability or difficulty moving, adding to the negative feelings. Blacking out is definitely a bad experience; it's disorienting and can be embarrassing.\n\nPutting this all together, the person is famous for a very unpleasant experience. They probably don't want to be known for fainting or feeling sick in public. This would likely make them feel embarrassed or uncomfortable, which are negative emotions.\n\nTherefore, even though fame is usually positive, the context here makes it a negative situation.

The phrase itself doesn't express an emotion directly but rather provides information about what the subject isn't.\n\nNow, thinking about the context where this might be used. Maybe someone is describing a movie or a show and clarifying its genre. For example, \"This film isn't a thriller; nor is it a romantic comedy.\" In that case, they're just stating facts without expressing any particular emotion towards those genres.\n\nSo, the sentiment here doesn't lean positive or negative. It's more of an informative statement. There's no praise for romantic comedies or criticism against them. It's just clarifying that the subject isn't in that category.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this as neutral because it doesn't convey any strong emotion.

It can be seen as a positive if it's making people feel something meaningful, but sometimes it might come off as manipulative depending on context.\n\n\"Dutifully\" \u2013 this word suggests they're doing their job without any complaints, maybe in an obligatory way. Not necessarily negative, just describes the manner of pulling heartstrings.\n\n\"Valiantly keep punching up the mix.\" \"Valiantly\" is a positive word meaning brave or courageous. \"Punching up the mix\" likely means they're adding more energy or excitement to the movie or project. So this part seems positive because it shows effort and improvement.\n\nPutting it together: The directors are doing their job well, making the audience feel emotions (heartstrings) in a way that's effective but maybe not over-the-top negative. They're also putting in good effort (\"valiantly\") to enhance the mix, which is a positive action.\n\nI don't see any strongly negative words here. \"Dutifully\" doesn't have a strong connotation either way; it's more about doing their duty. The overall tone seems positive because of the valiant effort and punching up the mix. There's no criticism or negative adjectives used against them.\n\nSo considering all that, the sentiment should be on the positive side but not extremely so.

Turning on a dime is an idiom meaning making a quick, sudden change. It doesn't inherently have a positive or negative connotation; it's more about the ability to change direction quickly.\n\nNext part: \"from oddly humorous.\" So when they turn one way, it's humorously odd. The word \"oddly\" here could be seen as slightly negative because it might imply that the humor isn't conventional or maybe unexpected in a way that's not enjoyable. But \"humorous\" is generally positive, so this is a mix.\n\nThen, \"to tediously sentimental.\" This seems more clearly negative. \"Tediously\" implies something that's boring or irritatingly slow. Sentimental can be positive when it refers to feelings, but combined with \"tedious,\" it becomes something that's perhaps overly emotional in a way that's annoying or tiresome.\n\nSo putting it all together: the text is talking about someone who changes quickly from something odd but humorous to something that's tedious and sentimental. The first part has some positive elements but is tempered by the word \"oddly.\" The second part is more clearly negative because of \"tediously.\"\n\nNow, considering sentiment scores: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive.\n\nThe text isn't extremely negative; there's a mix. It mentions humor, which is positive, but then it contrasts that with something tedious and sentimental, which leans more negative. The overall tone seems to be a bit critical of the changes, highlighting both sides but perhaps leaning towards the negative side because \"tediously\" stands out as a stronger negative adjective.\n\nSo I think this would fall into a 1, which is negative.

It's talking about a police drama, which is a genre, so neutral on its own. The phrase \"standard\" suggests it's not exceptional\u2014maybe a bit negative because standard can imply average or unremarkable.\n\nThen there's a conditional statement: if not for De Niro's participation. So, the sentiment here depends on what comes next. The sentence says that without him, it would have likely been a TNT original. TNT is known for producing TV shows, so maybe implying that without De Niro, the show wouldn't be as good or wouldn't reach a wider audience.\n\nWait, but does this make the sentiment negative? Let me think. If it's saying that the participation of De Niro elevates the show from being just a TNT original, which is perhaps seen as less prestigious, then maybe the implication is positive. But the way it's phrased sounds like without him, it would be average or lower quality.\n\nSo the overall sentiment might lean towards negative because it's saying the project isn't great on its own and only becomes notable because of De Niro. That could imply that the show is just average or perhaps not very good without his involvement.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure. Maybe \"TNT original\" isn't necessarily negative\u2014it's just stating where it would have aired. So, maybe the sentiment is neutral because it's pointing out the necessity of De Niro's role but not explicitly saying it's bad. \n\nWait, no\u2014because the implication is that without him, it wouldn't be as good or as notable. So perhaps it's slightly negative towards the show itself, suggesting it's only average without a big name like De Niro.\n\nSo considering all this, I think the sentiment is 1 (negative) because it's pointing out that the project isn't particularly special on its own and relies heavily on De Niro for value. That might come across as slightly negative towards the show's inherent quality.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence implies that the show wouldn't be notable without De Niro, suggesting it's average or below-average otherwise.

That's a negative connotation. \"Indulgence,\" on the other hand, typically refers to giving in to one's desires, which can be seen as positive because it's about enjoying something. But depending on context, indulgence might not always be positive.\n\nIn this phrase, \"dreary\" modifies \"indulgence.\" So, it's a gloomy or depressing kind of indulgence. That could imply that the indulgence isn't bringing much joy but rather some form of comfort in a negative situation. \n\nSo the overall sentiment is probably negative because \"dreary\" sets a somber tone. But since it's an indulgence, maybe there's a slight positive aspect to it because it's about giving in to something. However, the adjective here strongly leans towards negative.\n\nI'm thinking between 0 and 1. Since it's not extremely negative but still clearly on the negative side.

It starts with \"hardly a nuanced portrait,\" which sounds critical. Using words like \"hardly\" and \"not nuanced\" suggests that the film doesn't present a detailed or subtle depiction of the young woman's breakdown. That seems negative.\n\nHowever, the second part says, \"the film nevertheless works up a few scares.\" The word \"nevertheless\" indicates a contrast to the previous statement. So despite the criticism about the portrayal, the film does manage to create some scares. Scaring people is typically seen as a positive aspect in a horror or thriller movie context.\n\nSo the sentiment is mixed. There's a negative point about not being nuanced and a positive note about successfully creating scares. The first part might lean more towards negative, but since it also acknowledges that there are some positive aspects (the scares), it doesn't feel extremely negative.\n\nI should consider how these two parts balance each other. Is the negative aspect stronger than the positive? Or vice versa? The sentence structure gives equal weight to both points, so perhaps it's a middle ground. \n\nSince 2 is neutral and 3 is positive, but there was some negativity in the beginning, maybe it leans slightly towards neutral or maybe positive. But since the first part is quite negative (\"hardly nuanced\"), I think the overall sentiment might be on the lower side of the scale.\n\nBut wait, the second part does provide a positive aspect. So perhaps the sentiment isn't as negative as it could be because there's a redeeming quality mentioned. It's not all bad; it still manages to scare people.\n\nConsidering this balance, I think the sentiment is slightly negative but not extremely so. So maybe 1 (negative) would be appropriate. But some might argue that since it acknowledges a positive element, it shouldn't be too low.

Let's read it again: \"it irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence 's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere.\" \n\nHmm, the user is asking to classify this sentiment as an integer between 0 and 4. I remember that 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. The person says it \"irritates\" and \"saddens me.\" Those are strong negative emotions. So that's two negative words right there. They're talking about Martin Lawrence's latest movie getting a lot of screens (2,500) which might be implying it's being overhyped or given too much attention. The word \"explode obnoxiously\" suggests they think the release is annoyingly excessive.\n\nOn the flip side, they mention Bubba Ho-Tep, saying its quality is \"clearly evident,\" but it ends up \"languishing on a shelf.\" That means it's not getting the same opportunities or recognition. So the person feels that good work isn't being appreciated while mediocre stuff gets all the attention.\n\nPutting this together, the sentiment seems negative because they're expressing frustration and sadness about the situation. They're highlighting an unfair distribution of resources or attention between two movies based on their perceived quality. \n\nI don't think it's extremely negative (0) because there's no use of very harsh language beyond \"irritates\" and \"saddens.\" It's more of a disappointment than outright anger. So maybe 1, which is negative.\n\nWait, but does the mention of Bubba Ho-Tep having evident quality add any positive nuance? Maybe, but overall the sentiment is about the unfairness and sadness regarding distribution. So I think it leans towards negative rather than neutral or positive.\n\nSo the output should be 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to frustration and disappointment regarding the unequal treatment of two movies. The use of \"irritates\" and \"saddens\" indicates a clear negative emotion, and while there's a mention of quality in Bubba Ho-Tep, the overall tone is about unfairness. \n\n1", 1, 1, 51.090949380013626], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user has given a specific text to analyze and needs me to determine the sentiment on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). \n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully: \"as quiet , patient and tenacious as mr. lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline.\" Okay, so the focus here is on Mr. Lopez's characteristics and how he handles his work.\n\nBreaking it down, the adjectives used are \"quiet,\" \"patient,\" \"tenacious,\" \"serenity,\" and \"discipline.\" These all sound positive. Words like \"remarkable\" emphasize that his approach is commendable. The context describes him dealing with difficult and endless work but does so with a serene and disciplined manner, which suggests resilience and positivity.\n\nI should consider if there are any negative aspects. The mention of \"difficult\" and \"endless work\" might seem negative at first glance, but since it's framed as something he approaches serenely and disciplinarily, it actually highlights his positive traits in handling challenges.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment is clearly positive. There are no negative connotations once you consider the context.

Let me read the text again: \"lyne's latest, the erotic thriller unfaithful, further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded.\"\n\nHmm, so the sentence is talking about Lyne's latest work, which is an erotic thriller called Unfaithful. The key part here is \"further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded.\" Eroded means that something has worn away or deteriorated. So it's saying his storytelling skills aren't as good as they used to be; they've gotten worse.\n\nThe word \"eroded\" definitely has a negative connotation. It implies decline, which is not positive. Also, the use of \"further demonstrates\" suggests that this is an ongoing issue\u2014his skills have been eroding over time, and this latest work shows it even more.\n\nI should think about how strong this negative sentiment is. Is it very negative (0) or just negative (1)? The text doesn't use extremely harsh words like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" but it does point out a significant decline in his skills. So, the sentiment is definitely negative, but maybe not as extreme as 0.\n\nWait, let me consider if there's any positive aspect here. The movie is described as an erotic thriller, which could be seen as a genre that some people enjoy. But the focus of the sentence is on the decline in storytelling skills, so the positive aspects aren't highlighted here.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment is negative because it's pointing out a deterioration in Lyne's abilities. It's not extremely negative but clearly on the lower end.

It's talking about a writer/director named Burr Steers and his approach in emphasizing the 'quirkiness' of something. The phrase \"emphasizes the Q in quirky\" suggests that he's focusing on making things quirky, maybe in a movie or project.\n\nThen it says \"with mixed results.\" That part is key because \"mixed results\" typically means there's both positive and negative outcomes. So it's not all good or all bad. It implies some aspects worked well while others didn't.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment scale: 0 is very negative, 4 is very positive. If something has mixed results, it usually isn't extremely positive or extremely negative. It's somewhere in the middle but leaning towards neutral because there are both good and bad points.\n\nSo, I think the sentiment here is neutral.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the words used. The main word here is \"delights,\" which has a positive connotation. Delights mean something that brings pleasure or joy. So that's a good sign for a positive sentiment.\n\nThe phrase also mentions \"almost as many\" which suggests there are a lot of these delights. It seems like the film offers enjoyment to both adults and children, plus dog lovers. That's inclusive and probably appealing to a wide audience, which is a positive aspect.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. The structure is quite positive, highlighting that there's something for everyone in terms of enjoyment. So, considering all this, it seems like the sentiment is very positive. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check if \"almost\" could imply that maybe the delights aren't completely equal or as many as expected? Hmm, \"almost as many\" might suggest it's close but not exactly the same. However, in context, it still emphasizes a good number of delights for all groups mentioned.\n\nTherefore, I think the sentiment is very positive because it highlights enjoyment across different demographics without any negative indicators.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 4, 28.848326006991556], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me read through the text carefully.\n\nThe sentence is: \"Even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene, in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia, it's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon.\"\n\nHmm, first, I need to parse each part of this sentence. The first part talks about a ballroom scene with 3000 actors in full regalia. That sounds like a grand and elaborate setup. Then, the second part says it has \"waltzed itself into the art film pantheon.\" \n\n\"Waltzing\" here seems to be used metaphorically, implying that something moved gracefully or effortlessly. The \"art film pantheon\" suggests a place of high honor or recognition within the world of art films. So putting it together, the text is saying that even before reaching this elaborate scene, the film has already achieved significant acclaim or status in the art film category.\n\nNow, considering sentiment. Words like \"insanely staged\" might seem strong, but in this context, it's likely describing something impressive rather than negative. The overall tone seems positive because it's acknowledging the film's success and grandeur.\n\nSo, is there any negative connotation? I don't see any negative words here. It's all about achievements and elaborate setups which are generally positive aspects. Therefore, the sentiment should be on the higher end of the scale.\n\nBetween 3 (positive) and 4 (very positive), I think it leans towards very positive because it's not just a simple positive statement but is highlighting significant recognition and grandeur.

So when they say their \"crappola radar,\" it means they're usually good at spotting things that are not good. The phrase \"managed to make its way past\" suggests that whatever this thing is, it succeeded in getting through despite their defenses.\n\nThen, the second part says it found a small place in their heart. That's positive because having something in your heart implies care or affection. Even though they mention a radar for bad things, the fact that it made it into their heart shows acceptance or liking.\n\nPutting it together, the overall sentiment seems positive but not extremely so. They might be expressing mild approval or a small positive feeling towards whatever \"it\" is. So I think it's more than neutral but not very positive.

Let me read through the text again: \"the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers do n't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types.\"\n\nHmm, the sentence starts by acknowledging that the actresses created backstories and portrayed the characters convincingly. That's a positive point because it praises their effort and performance. However, the second part says that viewers don't get enough of that background, which makes the characters seem more like types instead of individuals.\n\nSo there are two parts here: one positive about the actresses' work and another negative about the lack of character depth from the audience's perspective. The key word is \"but,\" indicating a contrast between the two ideas. While the first part is complimentary, the second part is critical because it points out an issue that affects how viewers perceive the characters.\n\nThe criticism suggests that even though the actresses put in effort, the result isn't satisfying for the audience. This makes the overall sentiment lean negative. However, since the text doesn't express extreme negativity or harsh language, it's not extremely negative. It's more of a mild critique.\n\nConsidering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. The presence of both positive and negative elements makes it tricky, but the focus on the lack of background for viewers being an issue tips it into the negative category.

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure. The sentence starts by mentioning a 100-minute movie, which is pretty long\u2014about one hour forty minutes. Then it says \"only has about 25 minutes of decent material.\" So the speaker is comparing the total length to the amount of good content, which seems negative because most of the time isn't considered worthwhile.\n\nThe word \"only\" stands out here. It emphasizes that despite the movie's long runtime, there's not much worth watching. That definitely has a negative connotation. Also, using \"decent material\" implies that while some parts are okay, they're not great; it's just average or barely acceptable.\n\nI should consider how strong this sentiment is. Is it very negative (0) or just negative (1)? The speaker isn't outright calling the movie terrible but rather pointing out a significant portion is subpar. So maybe it's more on the negative side without being extremely harsh. \n\nAlso, there's no positive language here. Words like \"enjoyable\" or \"great\" are missing.

It starts with \"If you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you aren't very bright...\" So it's talking about someone enjoying something because they're getting rewards from a script that doesn't think they're very smart. Then it says, \"then Blood Work is for you.\" So the movie or show called Blood Work is being recommended to people who like this kind of thing.\n\nHmm, so the structure seems a bit sarcastic. The phrase \"assumes you aren't very bright\" has a negative connotation because it implies that the script doesn't think highly of the audience's intelligence. But then it says \"then Blood Work is for you,\" which could be a recommendation but in a way that might be critical.\n\nI'm trying to determine if this is positive or negative. On one hand, it's suggesting that Blood Work is suitable for people who like being rewarded by a script that doesn't challenge them intellectually. That could mean the sentiment is somewhat negative because it's implying that the content isn't very engaging or intelligent. But on the other hand, it might just be a neutral statement about who the movie appeals to.\n\nWait, but the way it's phrased sounds a bit dismissive. It's not outright saying it's bad, but it's positioning Blood Work as something for people who don't mind scripts that aren't very bright. So maybe there's an undercurrent of criticism here. The speaker might be implying that the movie isn't very deep or intellectually stimulating.\n\nSo putting this together, I think the sentiment leans negative because it's subtly criticizing the intelligence level required by the script and suggesting that Blood Work caters to a lower intellect audience. But it's not extremely negative; it's more of a mild criticism.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this as 1 (negative).

The output has to be one of five integers: 0 for very negative, up to 4 for very positive. Let's break down the text step by step.\n\nFirst, the text starts by comparing \"queen of the damned\" to an Anne Rice novel. It says it's better-focused than that incomprehensible novel. So, there's a slight positive note here because it's saying this version is better. But then, the overall sentiment seems negative because it describes the story as pointless and meandering.\n\nThe text continues by calling it a celebration of a goth-vampire lifestyle filled with tortured woe-is-me attitude. Using words like \"pointless\" and \"meandering\" gives a strong negative vibe. The phrase \"tortured woe-is-me\" suggests sadness and excessive self-pity, which isn't positive.\n\nSo, putting this together: there's a small positive point about being better focused than another novel, but the rest of the description is overwhelmingly negative. The overall sentiment seems to lean towards very negative because it's criticizing the story for being aimless and overly dramatic in a sad way.\n\nI think the sentiment here is 0 (very negative).

The main points are about showing characters in an act without remorse and repeatedly cutting back to a flashback of rape. The word \"overkill\" suggests that something is excessive or overly done. So putting it together, the sentiment seems negative because they're criticizing how the scenes are handled as being too extreme or harsh.\n\nI notice words like \"no feelings of remorse,\" which implies the characters aren't feeling bad about their actions, maybe making them seem worse. The use of \"overkill to the highest degree\" definitely shows frustration or dissatisfaction with how the content is portrayed. This makes me think the sentiment isn't just slightly negative but quite strong.\n\nSo considering the options: 0 is very negative, which fits because they're strongly criticizing the approach as excessive. Negative (1) might not capture the intensity. Neutral (2) doesn't apply here since there's a clear criticism. Positive or very positive are out of the question.

That already gives a positive impression because using the word \"like\" indicates approval or enjoyment. Then they mention \"Evelyn comes from the heart,\" which sounds heartfelt and genuine. Both parts of the sentence seem positive.\n\nThe user wants me to assign an integer from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative, up to 4 being very positive.

The subject here is Woody Allen, a well-known filmmaker and comedian. The phrase used is \"has really found his groove these days.\" The word \"groove\" generally means to find a comfortable or successful way of doing something, right? So when someone has found their groove, it suggests they're in a good place creatively or professionally.\n\nThe adverb \"really\" adds emphasis here, making the statement stronger. It's not just a casual observation but a notable improvement or achievement. The phrase \"these days\" indicates that this is a recent development, which might imply that Woody Allen has overcome some challenges or is experiencing a revival in his career.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment expressed seems positive because it's highlighting success and comfort in Woody Allen's current work. There are no negative words here; everything points towards approval and satisfaction with his recent endeavors.\n\nI don't think there's any neutrality here because the use of \"really\" makes it clear that this is a significant positive change. It's not just a mild observation but a strong endorsement. So, moving up from neutral to a more positive sentiment makes sense.\n\nOn the scale provided, 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 is neutral, 3 is positive, and 4 is very positive. Since the statement is definitely positive and emphasizes this with \"really,\" it's leaning towards being quite positive but not extremely so. So I think a score of 3 would be appropriate here because it shows approval without going overboard into hyperbole.\n\nI don't see any reason to rate it as very positive (4) unless there was more enthusiastic language, like \"amazing\" or \"fantastic.\" The word \"groove\" is positive but not superlative. Therefore, I'll go with 3 as the sentiment score.\n</think>\n\nThe statement positively highlights Woody Allen's recent success, emphasizing his comfort and effectiveness in his work.

Then, it's about a family reunion that was much anticipated, so initially, people were looking forward to it\u2014this could be neutral or slightly positive. But then it goes wrong because of culture shock and refusal to empathize. Culture shock is generally a negative experience, and refusing empathy implies insensitivity, which is also negative.\n\nSo putting it together: the documentary is about a family reunion that was expected to be good but turned out bad due to negative factors like culture shock and lack of empathy. The words \"brutally honest\" might indicate that the portrayal is harsh or realistic in its negativity.\n\nI think this leans towards negative sentiment because despite the anticipation, things went wrong with negative reasons.

I'm leaning toward a 1 as it's negative but not extremely so\u2014maybe not as harsh as a 0 which would be \"very negative.\" Alternatively, since it's described as brutally honest about a bad situation, maybe it's more negative than just a little.\n\nWait, perhaps the use of \"brutally honest\" doesn't necessarily mean the sentiment is negative; it could mean that the documentary portrays things realistically without sugarcoating. However, given that the reunion goes wrong due to culture shock and lack of empathy, which are both negative aspects, I think the overall sentiment expressed is negative.\n\nSo considering all this, maybe a 1 for negative. But I'm not entirely sure if it's just negative or very negative. Since it's about a documentary, perhaps the focus on honesty might make it more neutral? No, because the events themselves are negative\u2014reunion going wrong with those issues.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative due to the family reunion turning out poorly and highlighting negative factors like culture shock and lack of empathy.\n\n1", 1, 2, 48.07064422898111], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The output should be an integer from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive.\n\nFirst, let me read the text carefully: \"when it's not wallowing in hormonal melodrama, 'real women have curves' is a sweet, honest, and enjoyable comedy-drama about a young woman who wants many things in life, but fears she'll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams.\"\n\nOkay, breaking this down. The text starts by saying the movie isn't wallowing in hormonal melodrama. That phrase \"wallowing in\" usually has a negative connotation, suggesting that sometimes it does get into that, which might not be seen positively.\n\nThen it goes on to describe the movie as sweet, honest, and enjoyable. Those are definitely positive adjectives. Sweet implies warmth or charm, honest suggests authenticity, and enjoyable means it's pleasant to watch.\n\nThe latter part talks about a young woman wanting many things but fearing she'll become her mother before achieving her dreams. That could be seen as a bit of a downer because it touches on fear and unfulfilled aspirations. However, in the context of a comedy-drama, this might add depth rather than being purely negative.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The movie is criticized for sometimes getting into hormonal melodrama (negative point), but overall it's described as sweet, honest, and enjoyable (positive points). The story itself deals with some heavier themes but in a balanced way typical of a comedy-drama. \n\nI don't see any extremely strong negative or positive language beyond that. It seems like the sentiment leans more towards positive because the positives are highlighted and are stronger than the criticism mentioned at the beginning.\n\nSo, on the scale: 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit here; 1 is negative, but there's only a slight critique; 2 is neutral, but the positives seem to outweigh that; 3 is positive, which aligns with sweet, honest, and enjoyable; 4 would be very positive, but maybe it's not hyperbolic in praise.\n\nTherefore, I think the sentiment here is 3 (positive).\n</think>\n\nThe text describes \"Real Women Have Curves\" as sweet, honest, and enjoyable despite some criticism.

The sentence is: \"not kids , who do n't need the lesson in repugnance .\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the words here. \"Not kids\" probably means that the speaker is talking about people who aren't children. Then, they mention \"who don't need the lesson in repugnance.\" Repugnance refers to something that causes disgust or aversion. So putting it together, it seems like the speaker is saying that these individuals (who are not kids) don't require a lesson that teaches them something disgusting.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The word \"repugnance\" has a negative connotation because it's about finding something repulsive. However, the sentence structure says they \"don't need the lesson,\" which might imply that either they already know it or perhaps aren't subjected to it. This could be neutral or slightly positive depending on context.\n\nBut without more context, I have to rely solely on this sentence. The main negative word is \"repugnance.\" However, since they're saying these people don't need the lesson in repugnance, maybe it's suggesting that they are beyond needing such a lesson, which could be a positive thing. Alternatively, it might imply that they naturally avoid what's repulsive, which could also be neutral or slightly positive.\n\nI think overall, the sentiment leans towards neutral because while there's a negative term used, the context suggests that these individuals don't require that particular lesson, possibly indicating that they are already aware or unaffected by it. So maybe a 2 for neutral.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence uses \"repugnance,\" which is negative, but the structure implies these individuals don't need such a lesson, suggesting awareness or neutrality. Thus, the sentiment is neutral.\n\n2", 2, 2, 36.363659681985155], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is: \"steven soderbergh doesn't remake andrei tarkovsky's solaris so much as distill it.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what this sentence is saying. It mentions that Steven Soderbergh isn't remaking Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris but instead is distilling it. The word \"distill\" usually means to condense something by removing the less important parts, often implying a focus on the essence or core elements.\n\nSo, the sentiment here is about how Soderbergh approaches remaking Solaris. Instead of doing a direct remake, he's taking the original and making it more concentrated or refined. This could be seen as a positive approach because distilling might mean preserving the important aspects while improving upon them.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's any negative connotation. The word \"doesn't\" in this context doesn't seem negative; it's just stating that he isn't doing a direct remake. So overall, the sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive because it suggests a thoughtful and focused approach rather than a mere copy.\n\nGiven the options of 0 (very negative) up to 4 (very positive), I think this leans towards a neutral sentiment but with a slight positive nuance because distilling can imply enhancement or improvement. Therefore, I would classify this as a 2 for neutral since it's not overly positive but not negative either.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed is neutral, indicating that Steven Soderbergh is focusing on the essence of Solaris rather than a direct remake.\n\n2", 2, 1, 33.8226311650069], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

When someone says something is funny, they're typically expressing that it made them laugh or smile, which are positive emotions.\n\nNext, considering the structure of the sentence, it's a straightforward statement without any additional context. There's no negative words or phrases attached to \"funny,\" so there doesn't seem to be any sarcasm or hidden negativity here. It just seems like a genuine expression of finding something humorous.\n\nNow, thinking about sentiment scores: \"Funny\" is definitely positive, but how strong is that positivity? Since it's not an extreme word like \"hilarious\" or \"laugh-out-loud,\" which might push it towards the very positive side (4), \"funny\" feels more moderate. So I would place this at a 3 because it's clearly positive without being extremely so.\n\nI don't think there's any room for misinterpretation here. The sentiment is straightforward and positive, so assigning a 3 makes sense. There's no indication of neutrality because the word \"funny\" conveys a clear emotion, just not an overwhelmingly strong one.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 3, 32.34554060199298], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The possible outputs are integers from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the sentence: \"it isn't scary.\" It seems like a simple statement. Breaking it down, the subject is something that isn't scary. The word \"isn't\" is a contraction of \"is not,\" so the sentence is saying that whatever \"it\" refers to lacks scariness.\n\nNext, I'll consider the context. Without more information about what \"it\" is referring to, it's a bit challenging. But given just this sentence, I can analyze the sentiment based on the words used. The key word here is \"scary,\" which generally has a negative connotation because being scared is an unpleasant emotion.\n\nThe negation in \"isn't scary\" flips that. Instead of something being scary (which would be negative), it's not scary. So, this could be seen as a positive thing if someone was hoping for less scariness. For example, if someone was talking about a movie and said it isn't scary, they might mean it's more enjoyable because there's no fear involved.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that \"isn't scary\" doesn't inherently carry strong positive emotions. It's more of a neutral statement unless there's context implying positivity. Since the context is missing, I have to rely solely on this sentence.\n\nIn terms of sentiment analysis, neutral statements often fall around 2 on the scale provided (0-very negative, 1-negative, 2-neutral, 3-positive, 4-very positive). This sentence doesn't express any strong emotion; it's a factual statement about something not being scary. Therefore, I wouldn't classify it as positive or negative without more context.\n\nSo, considering all that, the sentiment here is neutral. It neither conveys negativity nor positivity strongly. Hence, the appropriate score would be 2.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence \"it isn't scary.\" is a neutral statement indicating something lacks scariness.

Let me break down what each part means.\n\nThe sentence starts with \"well,\" which can be neutral or slightly hesitant. Then, it says, \"it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting its praises.\" That part sounds negative because it's saying the experience isn't so great that people will be super excited about it. Swinging from trees and hooting are metaphors for being really enthusiastic, so if it doesn't do that, it might not be fantastic.\n\nBut then the sentence continues: \"but it's definitely worth taking a look.\" That part is positive because it's recommending the item despite not being extremely exciting. So there's a contrast here\u2014acknowledging it's not perfect but still worthwhile.\n\nPutting it together, the overall sentiment isn't very negative or very positive. It's somewhere in the middle. The first part is slightly negative, and the second part is positive but not overly so.

It says it's \"refreshing\" to see a romance that's \"this smart.\" The word \"refreshing\" usually has a positive connotation; it suggests something new and invigorating. When someone describes a romance as \"smart,\" they're likely complimenting it for being clever or intelligent, which is another positive trait.\n\nPutting those two together, the speaker seems to be expressing satisfaction or approval of the romance. The phrase doesn't contain any negative words, so I can rule out 0 and 1. It's definitely not neutral either because \"refreshing\" conveys a clear positive emotion. So that leaves us with 3 (positive) or 4 (very positive). \n\nSince the sentence is expressing enthusiasm about how smart and refreshing the romance is, it seems more than just a simple positive sentiment; it feels quite strong.

It's a comedy from 1980, right? It's got a lot of slapstick humor and some memorable characters, so I think people generally like it or at least find it entertaining.\n\nThen there's The Loyal Order of Raccoons. Wait, isn't that also a movie? I'm not as familiar with this one. Let me try to recall. Oh yeah, it's from 1985 and it's about raccoons, which are generally seen as cute animals. But the title sounds like it might be more of a children's movie or maybe something light-hearted.\n\nSo putting them together, \"Caddyshack crossed with The Loyal Order of Raccoons.\" That makes me think they're comparing this new thing (maybe another movie?) to these two films. Now, if someone is saying it's a mix of both, what does that imply?\n\nCaddyshack is pretty funny but maybe a bit more on the raunchy or slapstick side. The Loyal Order of Raccoons, I think, was a family-friendly film with some heartwarming elements. So combining them could mean it has elements of comedy and perhaps some cuteness.\n\nNow, the sentiment here. If someone says something is like these two movies, are they being positive or negative? Well, both movies have their fans. Caddyshack is beloved for its humor, and The Loyal Order of Raccoons, even though maybe not as well-known, has a certain charm.\n\nThe user's instruction is to classify the sentiment on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). So, looking at this sentence again, it doesn't use any explicitly positive or negative words. It just compares something to these two movies without adding adjectives like \"great\" or \"terrible.\"\n\nSo, maybe the sentiment is neutral because they're just stating a comparison without expressing an opinion on whether it's good or bad. However, sometimes when people compare things to well-known titles, they might be implying that it's similar in quality. But since there's no clear indication here, I think it's safer to go with neutral.\n\nWait, but could it be slightly positive? Because both movies are generally liked, maybe the person is saying this thing is good because it's like those two. But without explicit words, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe they're just making a descriptive statement without any emotional charge.\n\nI think I'll go with neutral because there's no clear indication of positive or negative sentiment in the phrasing. The dots after \"What we get ...\" might even suggest some pause or uncertainty, but not enough to tip it into negative.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 2, 58.50281161998282], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It mentions that Wilco fans will have a great time, which is clearly positive. \"Great time\" indicates enjoyment and satisfaction, so that's a strong positive sentiment right there.\n\nNext part: \"the movie should win the band a few new converts too.\" The word \"win\" suggests success or achievement, and \"new converts\" likely means attracting new fans. So this implies that the movie is effective in bringing in more supporters for Wilco, which is another positive point.\n\nPutting it together, both parts of the sentence express positivity without any negative words. It's not just neutral because there are clear positive indicators like \"great time\" and \"win new converts.\" \n\nNow considering the scale: 0 is very negative, which isn't the case here. 1 is negative but again, nothing negative in this text. Neutral would be if it was factual without emotion, but since both parts have positive feelings, it's more than neutral. Positive (3) fits because there are definite positive statements, but does it reach \"very positive\" (4)? The language isn't extremely enthusiastic; it's more moderately positive. So I think 3 is the right choice.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a positive sentiment with phrases like \"great time\" and attracting new fans.

The main points are \"waiting for godard can be fruitful\" and that \"In Praise of Love\" is the director's epitaph for himself. \n\n\"Waiting for Godard\" refers to a film, and saying it can be \"fruitful\" suggests that the experience or the act of waiting has positive outcomes. The word \"fruitful\" generally implies something productive or beneficial, so that leans towards positive sentiment.\n\nNext part: \"In Praise of Love is the director's epitaph for himself.\" An epitaph usually refers to a short text honoring someone, often found on gravestones. Using it here might mean that this film serves as a summary or final statement about love from the director. The phrase \"in praise of love\" directly mentions praising love, which is a positive theme.\n\nPutting it together, both parts seem to highlight positive aspects\u2014waiting being fruitful and a film celebrating love. However, using \"epitaph\" might add a touch of reflection or culmination rather than overt positivity. So the sentiment isn't extremely positive but more on the neutral-positive side.\n\nI think the overall tone is slightly positive because it's acknowledging something valuable without strong emotional language. Therefore, I'll score this as 3 (positive) since it leans towards positive without being very intense.\n</think>\n\nThe text highlights a fruitful experience and praise for love, indicating a positive sentiment with a reflective touch. \n\n3", 3, 3, 37.76087524002651], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The words used here are pretty strong. Let's break it down.\n\n\"Unfunny\" immediately tells me that the reviewer didn't find the movie humorous at all. That's a negative sentiment right there.\n\nNext, \"lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters.\" This suggests that the characters weren't developed well, and the writer didn't care about them. That's another negative point because it shows a lack of depth in character development.\n\nThen, the reviewer mentions that the comedy relies on \"toilet humor\" and \"ethnic slurs.\" Both of these are considered lowbrow or offensive elements. Toilet humor is generally seen as crude and not particularly funny in a sophisticated way. Ethnic slurs are definitely problematic because they can be hurtful and offensive to certain groups. This indicates that the reviewer didn't appreciate the content, finding it both tacky and harmful.\n\nPutting all this together, the overall sentiment is negative. The movie isn't just not good; it's actively bad in ways that offend or annoy people. So, I need to decide whether this falls under 0 (very negative) or maybe a lower score but perhaps not as extreme.\n\nWait, 0 represents \"very negative.\" Since the review uses strong language about the lack of humor and offensive content, it seems like the sentiment is indeed very negative. The reviewer isn't just disappointed; they're clearly upset by the movie's approach.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses strong negative language such as \"unfunny,\" \"lacking any sense of commitment,\" and mentions reliance on offensive elements like toilet humor and ethnic slurs, indicating a very negative sentiment.\n\n0", 0, 0, 41.72095813500346], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence provided is: \"What's worse is that Pelosi knows it.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the components of this sentence. The phrase \"what's worse\" immediately sets a negative tone because \"worse\" implies something bad or undesirable happening beyond an initial problem. So right there, we have a negative sentiment.\n\nNext, \"is that Pelosi knows it.\" Here, Pelosi is being mentioned in a context where she is aware of the situation. The word \"knows\" doesn't inherently carry a positive or negative connotation on its own. However, when combined with \"what's worse,\" it suggests that Pelosi's awareness adds to the negativity. Maybe the speaker feels that Pelosi is complicit or informed about something bad.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence expresses frustration or disappointment, indicating that the situation is worse than previously thought because Pelosi is aware of it. This likely conveys a sense of betrayal or exacerbation of the problem.\n\nI should consider if there are any positive elements here, but I don't see any. The words used are neutral to negative, with \"worse\" being the key indicator of negativity. There's no indication of positivity or neutrality in the statement; it's all about something being worse because of Pelosi's knowledge.\n\nSo on the scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive), I need to assign a number. Since the sentiment is definitely negative, but not extremely so\u2014there\u2019s no strong adjectives beyond \"worse\"\u2014I might consider it as moderately negative. However, given that \"worse\" can imply a significant level of negativity, perhaps it's closer to very negative.\n\nWait, but sometimes \"what's worse\" can be used to escalate a point without necessarily being the most severe form of negativity. It depends on context. If the situation is already bad and this adds another layer, maybe it's just negative rather than very negative.\n\nBut considering the structure, it's more than just negative; it's pointing out that the situation is worse because Pelosi knows about it, which might imply a deeper issue or perhaps corruption, making it more severe in the speaker's eyes.

The term \"chirpy\" is generally positive, describing someone as cheerful or lively. But then it says \"songbird,\" which is a nice way to refer to a singer, so that's also positive. So far, the beginning seems okay, maybe even slightly positive because of those adjectives.\n\nBut then the tone changes with \"has popped up.\" The word \"popped\" can sometimes imply something sudden or unexpected, but in this context, it might not be entirely negative yet. It's more about the introduction of something new. \n\nThe next part is crucial: \"with more mindless drivel.\" Here, \"mindless\" clearly has a negative connotation, meaning without intelligence or thought. And \"drivel\" is slang for nonsense or meaningless talk. So putting that together, it's saying Britney Spears is coming out with more worthless or nonsensical content.\n\nSo combining the two parts: the positive description of her as a cheerful singer is contrasted with the negative comment about her new work being mindless. The focus here seems to be on the criticism of her recent output rather than her overall persona. Therefore, the sentiment leans towards negative because the latter part of the sentence carries more weight.\n\nI should consider the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive.

Then we have \"lackluster,\" which I know means something that isn't impressive or isn't up to standard. So putting them together, \"dramatically lackluster\" sounds pretty negative.\n\nI'm thinking about the scale. 0 is very negative, and 1 is just negative. Since both words are clearly negative\u2014especially \"lackluster\"\u2014the sentiment must be on the lower end. But does it reach a 0 or stay at 1?\n\n\"Dramatically\" might make it more intense, so maybe the sentiment is stronger than a regular negative statement. However, while \"dramatically lackluster\" is definitely negative, I don't know if it's the most extreme form of negativity. It\u2019s not something like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" which might be 0. But wait, \"lackluster\" itself isn't as harsh as those words either.\n\nI'm a bit confused now. Maybe I should think about context. If someone describes something as \"dramatically lackluster,\" they're emphasizing how unimpressive it is. So maybe that's strong enough to be 0. But then again, sometimes people use intensifiers without the sentiment being extremely negative. It could still be just a regular negative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"dramatically\" doesn't necessarily make the sentiment worse but just emphasizes it. So if \"lackluster\" is a 1 (negative), adding \"dramatically\" might push it to 0 because it's more intense. \n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The word \"lackluster\" alone would probably be a 1, but with \"dramatically,\" it's taking that negative aspect further. So maybe it's a 0, very negative.\n\nWait, no. Maybe not. If someone uses \"dramatically lackluster,\" they might still not mean it as extremely bad but just more so than average. So perhaps it's a 1. But I'm not entirely sure. I think I'll go with 0 because the use of \"dramatically\" suggests a stronger negative sentiment.\n</think>\n\n0", 0, 0, 52.53165562899085], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The user starts by saying they \"have to love\" a Disney picture. That's a strong positive sentiment right there. Using the phrase \"got to love\" is pretty enthusiastic.\n\nThen they mention that the movie has \"as little cleavage as this one has.\" So they're pointing out that there's not much focus on that aspect, which might be seen as positive if you value less objectification or more substance in characters.\n\nNext, they talk about the heroine being \"feisty and principled.\" Feisty implies she's strong-willed and perhaps a bit bold, while principled means she has good moral values. Both of these are positive traits. Disney heroines are often praised for their strength, so highlighting that adds to the positivity.\n\nPutting it all together: The overall tone is positive because they're expressing appreciation for the movie's approach and the heroine's character. They seem happy with what the film offers, especially in terms of character depth rather than just physical traits.\n\nI don't see any negative words here. Everything points towards a favorable view of the Disney pic and its main character. So on the scale from 0 to 4, this should be at least a 3 or maybe even a 4.

It starts with \"then again,\" which often signals a contrast or an alternative thought. So maybe they're comparing something here. Then it says, \"in a better movie,\" which suggests that whatever they're talking about isn't as good as it could be. The phrase continues with \"you might not have noticed,\" implying that in a better movie, the issue wouldn't have been noticeable.\n\nPutting it together, the speaker is pointing out that there's something lacking or perhaps a flaw in the current movie being discussed. By saying that in a better movie you wouldn't notice this, they're indicating that the current one isn't up to par. So the sentiment here is negative because it's highlighting a deficiency.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. Since the statement is pointing out a flaw in a movie by comparison, it leans towards being negative but isn't extremely harsh. It's not overly enthusiastic either, so I don't think it's neutral. So probably somewhere between 0 and 1.\n\nThe phrase doesn't use strong negative words like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" just the implication that it's not as good as a better movie.

The phrase is about \"unbridled greed and materialism,\" which are both criticized here.\n\nSo combining these elements, the sentence is expressing a harsh criticism of greed and materialism. There's no positive language used; instead, it uses words that convey strong negative feelings towards those concepts.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, which seems fitting because the sentiment is quite harsh. It doesn't just express dissatisfaction but something more intense with \"devastating.\" Negative would be a 1, but this feels stronger than that. Neutral is 2, positive 3, and very positive 4.

It mentions a \"picture,\" which probably refers to a movie or perhaps an image. The phrase \"doesn't know it's a comedy\" suggests that the picture isn't living up to what one might expect from a comedy. So, maybe the person feels that the intended humor wasn't effective.\n\nI need to assess if this is negative or positive. Since the sentence implies that something expected (a comedy) didn't meet expectations, it leans towards disappointment. That would be a negative sentiment. Now, how strong is this negativity?\n\nThe statement isn't overly harsh; it's more of a critique than an outright attack. So maybe not the most extreme negative but still clearly on the negative side. Considering the options, 0 is very negative, which might be too strong for this case. A 1 would represent negative sentiment, which seems appropriate here because while it's critical, it's not overly so.\n\nI don't think it's neutral because there's a clear critique.

That's good.\n\n\"Stark portrait\" might be neutral or slightly negative because \"stark\" can imply something is harsh or unrelenting. But it's also about how the elements come together in a strong way.\n\n\"Motherhood deferred\" suggests that motherhood isn't happening as expected, which could be seen as negative or bittersweet. It implies delay or postponement, maybe due to some challenges or circumstances.\n\n\"Desire explored\" is more neutral. Exploring desire can mean looking into it deeply, but without an emotional charge specified, it's hard to say if this is positive or negative. It might just be descriptive.\n\nPutting it all together: The sentence describes elements coming together in a strong way to depict motherhood that's been deferred and the exploration of desire. The word \"stark\" gives a serious tone, but not necessarily negative. The overall sentiment isn't overtly happy or sad; it's more about presenting these themes in a cohesive manner.\n\nSo I think the sentiment is neutral because there's no clear positive or negative emotion expressed beyond the descriptive elements.

The text is \"degenerates into hogwash.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the words. \"Degenerates\" means to decline in quality or value. It's a negative term on its own because it implies something getting worse over time. Then there's \"hogwash,\" which I know is an informal term meaning nonsense or rubbish. So putting them together, \"degenerates into hogwash\" suggests that whatever was being discussed has declined into nonsense or poor quality.\n\nI should consider the context. Without additional context, I have to go solely on these words. Both words carry strong negative connotations. \"Degenerates\" indicates a downward spiral, and \"hogwash\" is dismissive and critical. There's no positive language here; it's all about something becoming worse or being of low value.\n\nNow, thinking about the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, etc. Since both words are quite strong in their negativity, this seems more than just a mild negative sentiment. It's not just a little bad but rather a significant decline into something bad.\n\nI don't think it's 0 because maybe the user didn't use the strongest possible terms.

The part after \"but\" seems more significant because it changes the tone. It says that when the showdown happens, the person's senses are compared to mushy peas, which is definitely not positive. Mushy peas can be seen as something unpleasant or unenjoyable.\n\nThen it adds that you don't care who wins, implying a lack of interest or perhaps apathy. That sounds negative because it shows disengagement or maybe even dissatisfaction with the outcome.\n\nPutting it all together: The text starts with something neutral (showdown), but then the latter part is clearly negative due to the mushy comparison and apathy towards the result.

Let me read the text again: \"a timely look back at civil disobedience, anti-war movements and the power of strong voices.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the sentence. The phrase starts with \"a timely look back,\" which suggests that the topic is relevant or current. That usually has a positive connotation because it implies relevance.\n\nNext, it mentions \"civil disobedience\" and \"anti-war movements.\" These are typically associated with social justice and opposition to conflict. People might view these as positive actions aimed at change, though they can sometimes be controversial. However, in the context of discussing their power or influence, it's likely meant positively.\n\nThen there's \"the power of strong voices.\" This clearly has a positive sentiment because it's highlighting the effectiveness or impact of certain individuals or groups speaking out.\n\nPutting it all together, each component leans towards positivity without any overtly negative words. The focus is on reflection and recognition of significant movements that have had a meaningful effect. So, I don't see any negative undertones here; instead, it's more about acknowledging the influence and timeliness of these subjects.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment seems to be positive but not extremely so. It doesn't use superlatives like \"incredible\" or \"wonderful,\" which might have pushed it towards a higher score. Instead, it's a balanced view highlighting important aspects.

The phrase starts by mentioning \"a different kind of love story,\" which immediately makes me think it's about a romantic or emotional narrative. Love stories are generally seen as positive or neutral, depending on how they're portrayed.\n\nThen, the text describes this story as \"dark\" and \"disturbing.\" Those words have negative connotations. Dark can mean serious, intense, or dealing with heavy themes. Disturbing suggests something unsettling or uncomfortable to watch, which is definitely a negative aspect.\n\nNext, it says it's \"painful to watch,\" which reinforces the negative feelings. Painful implies that watching this story causes discomfort or emotional distress. That\u2019s another negative point.\n\nHowever, the text also mentions that it's \"compelling.\" Compelling means interesting and engaging in a way that holds your attention. This word is positive because it suggests that despite the dark and disturbing elements, there's something about the story that makes it worth watching. It might be intriguing or thought-provoking, which are positive traits.\n\nSo putting this all together: The sentiment has both negative and positive aspects. On one hand, the story is described with terms like dark, disturbing, and painful\u2014those are definitely negative descriptors. But on the other hand, it's compelling, which is a positive point that might balance out some of those negatives.\n\nI need to decide where this lands on the scale. If I consider 0 as very negative and 4 as very positive, let me think about how strong each sentiment is. The story isn't outright terrible or completely positive; instead, it's somewhere in between. The fact that it's a love story adds a layer of positivity, but the descriptors make it more intense.\n\nI think neutral would be 2, but this seems to have a mix. Since there are both negative and positive elements, maybe it leans slightly more towards negative because dark, disturbing, and painful are strong words. But the compelling aspect might push it towards neutral or even slightly positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider how each word affects the overall sentiment. Dark and disturbing are quite heavy, but they're balanced by the fact that it's still a love story and that it's compelling. Compelling can sometimes imply that despite the negative aspects, there's something worthwhile about it. So maybe it's not too negative.\n\nI think I'll go with 2 as neutral because while there are negative descriptors, the positive aspect of being a compelling love story keeps it balanced. It doesn't lean heavily in either direction but sits somewhere in the middle.\n</think>\n\nThe text presents a mix of negative and positive sentiments. While words like \"dark,\" \"disturbing,\" and \"painful\" suggest negativity, the term \"compelling\" introduces positivity.

It adds a layer of emphasis but doesn't necessarily make the sentiment more positive; instead, it intensifies how bad the situation is. \n\nNext, \"irredeemably\" is an adverb meaning beyond redemption or improvement. This word strongly suggests that there's no saving grace in whatever is being described\u2014it\u2019s entirely negative.\n\nThe adjective \"awful\" itself has a clearly negative connotation.

Then it says \"yet deeply watchable.\" \"Deeply watchable\" sounds positive because it suggests it's engaging or entertaining enough to keep watching despite the frustration.\n\nNext part: \"melodrama that makes you think it's a tougher picture than it is.\" Melodramas can be seen as emotional or over-the-top, which might not always be a bad thing depending on context. The phrase \"makes you think it's a tougher picture\" could imply that the movie appears more intense or challenging than it actually is. That might mean it doesn't live up to expectations in terms of depth but still manages to hold interest.\n\nSo putting it all together: There are both negative and positive elements. The frustration is a clear negative, but the watchability and the intrigue from making you think about its toughness add positives. I need to weigh these aspects.\n\nOn a scale from 0 to 4, considering there's both criticism and appreciation. It's not extremely negative because it's still described as watchable. It's also not very positive because of the frustration mentioned. So probably somewhere in the middle. The midpoint is 2 (neutral), but maybe leaning towards slightly more positive since \"deeply watchable\" might carry a bit more weight.\n\nWait, or maybe it's neutral? The frustration could balance out the watchability. Or perhaps a touch more negative because the initial word is frustrating. Hmm. Alternatively, considering that despite being frustrating, it's still watchable and makes you think\u2014it adds some value beyond just entertainment. So maybe it's slightly positive?\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to find synonyms or sentiment scores for the words. \"Frustrating\" is negative, \"deeply watchable\" is positive, \"melodrama\" could be neutral depending on context, but in this case, combined with making you think it's tougher, maybe slightly positive as it implies some depth.\n\nAlternatively, if \"tougher picture than it is\" means that it doesn't deliver the intensity it suggests, that could be negative. So perhaps a mix of frustration and disappointment because it didn't meet expectations. But also, being watchable despite that.\n\nSo overall, I think it's neutral or slightly positive.

The person is saying it's just for entertainment, so while it doesn't hold high value, it still can be enjoyable in a casual setting. So perhaps there's a slight positive nuance because even though they don't think it's worth owning or seeing, they acknowledge that it serves its purpose as light entertainment.\n\nPutting it all together: The sentiment isn't very negative because the speaker isn't criticizing it harshly; instead, they're just stating it's average. It's also not neutral because there is a slight preference towards being casual rather than dismissive.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the words used. The word \"gloriously\" stands out because it's an adverb that usually conveys something done in a magnificent or splendid way. It typically has a positive connotation. So right off the bat, that suggests positivity.\n\nNext, the phrase \"straight from the vagina.\" Now, this part could be a bit tricky. Depending on the context, this could have different implications. If someone is talking about something being authentic or natural, like maybe food or an experience, saying it's straight from a source might imply it's genuine or unprocessed, which can be seen as positive. However, without more context, I'm not entirely sure if that's the case here.\n\nPutting it together, \"gloriously\" is definitely positive, and \"straight from the vagina\" could either add to that positivity by emphasizing authenticity or it could potentially have a negative connotation depending on how it's perceived. But since \"gloriously\" is such a strong positive word, I think it tips the balance towards a positive sentiment.\n\nI also need to consider if there are any slang terms or idiomatic expressions here that might change the meaning. The term \"vagina\" isn't inherently negative; it's just a anatomical term. So unless there's some implication of something bad associated with it, which I don't see in this context, it doesn't add negativity.\n\nSo overall, while \"straight from the vagina\" is neutral on its own, combined with \"gloriously,\" the sentiment leans positive. It might be someone praising something for being authentic or natural without any negative undertones.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 2, 38.92540100598126], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase is talking about bringing awareness to something that's usually not noticed enough\u2014women's depression. Awareness can be a neutral term, but in this context, it seems positive because it highlights an important issue that's often ignored.\n\nI should consider the sentiment of each part. \"Brings awareness\" is generally positive as it implies action towards understanding or solving a problem. The second part mentions an overlooked issue, which adds to the positive sentiment because it shows concern for an underrepresented topic.\n\nSo putting it together, the sentence is highlighting a positive step in addressing women's depression, which is a significant and often ignored issue. Therefore, the sentiment leans more on the positive side but not extremely so. It's acknowledging progress without being overly enthusiastic.\n\nI think this should be classified as 3 (positive) because it conveys a constructive message about raising awareness for an important cause.\n</think>\n\nThe text highlights a positive action towards addressing an important issue, which is bringing attention to women's depression that is often overlooked.

Then comes a list of adjectives: mindless, lifeless, meandering, loud, painful, obnoxious. These are all strong negative terms.\n\n\"Mindless\" suggests it lacks depth or intelligence. \"Lifeless\" implies it's dull and lacking energy. \"Meandering\" means it's wandering without direction, which is not a compliment for a movie. \"Loud\" could be about the sound being overwhelming, maybe annoying. \"Painful\" and \"obnoxious\" are pretty harsh, indicating discomfort or irritation.\n\nPutting it all together, these words express strong dislike.

The sentence is: \"After you laugh once (maybe twice), you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break it down. The user mentions laughing, which is generally a positive or at least neutral action. Laughing can indicate that parts of the movie were amusing or entertaining. So on the surface, that part sounds positive.\n\nBut then there's the second part where they say you'll have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car. This suggests that despite any initial amusement, the overall impression wasn't strong enough to leave a lasting memory. It implies that while there were moments of enjoyment, the movie as a whole didn't make a significant impact or wasn't memorable.\n\nSo putting it together: The mention of laughter indicates some positive elements, but forgetting the movie quickly suggests that those positives weren't enough to create a meaningful connection. This makes me think the sentiment is more on the negative side because forgetting implies it wasn't impactful or enjoyable enough to stay in one's memory.\n\nConsidering the scale where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive, I need to decide where this falls. The presence of laughter might bump it up from a 0 (very negative), but the forgetting part brings it down. So maybe a 1? It's negative because the overall experience wasn't memorable despite some moments of enjoyment.\n\nWait, but another angle: Sometimes people forget things they didn't care about, which can be neutral or slightly negative. If someone laughs and then quickly forgets, perhaps it's just that the movie was average\u2014neither really good nor bad. So maybe a 2? But I think the emphasis on forgetting quickly after only laughing once or twice leans more towards the movie not being impactful, hence leaning negative.\n\nSo I'm torn between 1 and 2. On one hand, the laughter is positive, but the forgetting indicates it wasn't memorable enough, which could be seen as slightly negative or neutral. Given that, perhaps a 1 would be more accurate because while there was some enjoyment, the overall experience was forgettable, indicating a mild negative sentiment.\n</think>\n\nThe text mentions laughter, which is positive, but the quick forgetting of the movie suggests it wasn't memorable.

The user has given me a text snippet: \"a spiffy animated feature about an unruly adolescent boy who is yearning for adventure and a chance to prove his worth.\" My task is to classify the sentiment expressed in this text on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nFirst, I'll start by analyzing the words used. The word \"spiffy\" stands out because it's a positive adjective meaning stylish or impressive. This immediately gives a positive vibe to the description.\n\nNext, looking at the rest of the sentence: \"animated feature\" suggests it's about a movie or show, which is neutral on its own but in this context adds to the positive feel since it's paired with \"spiffy.\" \n\nThe phrase \"unruly adolescent boy\" describes the main character. While \"unruly\" might imply some challenges or mischievousness, in a story context, this can be seen as an opportunity for growth or adventure, which is often portrayed positively.\n\nThen, \"yearning for adventure and a chance to prove his worth.\" The words \"yearning,\" \"adventure,\" and \"prove his worth\" all carry positive connotations. They suggest aspiration, determination, and the pursuit of self-improvement, which are typically viewed favorably.\n\nPutting it all together: The text describes an animated feature in a positive light with a main character who is driven by a desire for adventure and recognition. There's no negative language present; instead, the focus is on positive attributes and goals.\n\nI also consider the context of such descriptions. When promoting movies or books, using positive adjectives helps attract audiences, so this likely isn't just an objective description but also serves to entice viewers positively.\n\nTherefore, weighing all these elements, the sentiment leans towards being very positive. It's not just a neutral description; it actively highlights positive aspects and character traits.\n</think>\n\n3", 3, 3, 37.770002602017485], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase \"mean machine\" could be interpreted as tough or relentless, which might carry a slightly negative connotation depending on context.\n\nSo, putting this together: The sentiment isn't extremely positive because it's pointing out a limitation regarding big screens. It's also not very negative since it's described as decent and a good TV outing. Therefore, the overall feeling is neutral but leaning slightly towards positive because \"decent\" is a positive adjective. \n\nI think assigning a 2 makes sense here\u2014neutral with a slight positive tilt.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is neutral, acknowledging that while it's a decent TV experience, it lacks something special for the big screen.\n\n2", 2, 1, 25.167520438990323], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It's talking about a film where swinging doesn't attract the young and fit. So, what does that imply? The film is showing that swinging isn't something that appeals to younger people who are in good shape.\n\nI need to determine if this sentiment is negative or positive. Since it's saying that swinging doesn't attract the young and fit, maybe the implication is that swinging is more for older people or those not as physically active. But does that make the statement negative?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the film is just stating a fact without any emotional charge. It could be neutral if it's just describing the target audience of swinging in the context of the film.\n\nI'm trying to see if there's any positive spin here. Maybe the film shows swinging as something more mature or for different groups, which isn't inherently negative. But I don't see any positive language used; it's more of an observation than a judgment.\n\nSo, considering all that, the sentiment doesn't seem strongly negative. It's not praising anything either, so it's probably neutral. Therefore, I think the correct classification is 2.\n</think>\n\nThe statement describes swinging as something that doesn't attract the young and fit, without expressing a strong positive or negative emotion.

So I'm looking at whether \"often hilarious\" leans more towards positivity or not.\n\nThe word \"hilarious\" is a strong positive adjective; it's used to describe something that causes laughter, joy, or amusement. When someone says something is hilarious, they're expressing a high level of enjoyment or satisfaction. The adverb \"often\" here adds that this humor isn't just occasional but frequent. So the sentiment expressed is definitely positive.\n\nNow, considering the scale again: since 4 is very positive and 3 is positive, I need to decide which category \"often hilarious\" falls into. While it's clearly positive, does it reach the level of being 'very' positive? The word \"hilarious\" itself is quite strong, indicating a high degree of positivity. Adding \"often\" emphasizes that this isn't just a one-time thing but happens regularly. So together, they convey a consistently positive experience.\n\nI should also think about context. Without more surrounding text, I have to rely on the words given. There's no indication of any negative sentiment here; it's all about humor and enjoyment. Therefore, it makes sense that this would be scored higher on the positivity scale.\n\nSo putting it all together: \"often hilarious\" is a very positive statement because it frequently brings joy through humor.

It's talking about a historical epic that spans decades. That part sounds factual, so maybe neutral. Then it says it \"strives to be intimate and socially encompassing.\" Striving usually implies effort but not necessarily success. So this could be slightly positive or just neutral because it's about intent.\n\nThe next part is crucial: \"but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time.\" The word \"fails\" is a strong negative indicator. It means the movie didn't achieve what it set out to do, which is a criticism.

This critique suggests dissatisfaction or disappointment, leaning towards a negative sentiment.\n\nNow, considering the scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive), this seems more than just neutral but not extremely negative. It's clearly expressing that the film didn't meet expectations, which is a negative point. However, it doesn't use overly harsh language like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" so maybe it's not the most extreme negative.\n\nSo I think 1 (negative) would be appropriate because while there's criticism, it's not extremely harsh. The sentiment is definitely on the negative side but not as severe as a very negative score.\n</think>\n\nThe text describes a film that ambitiously aims to be both intimate and socially encompassing but criticizes its failure to achieve these goals within three hours.

First, the phrase starts with \"it all comes down to,\" which suggests that something significant hinges on a particular condition here. The condition in question is being able to tolerate Leon Barlow.\n\nNow, tolerance implies that there might be some issues or challenges involved with Leon Barlow. If someone has to tolerate another person, it usually means they don't particularly enjoy the situation or find it easy. It could hint at some level of dissatisfaction or discomfort.\n\nBut wait, does this necessarily make the sentiment negative? Well, \"tolerate\" isn't explicitly positive; it's more about endurance or putting up with something. So if Leon Barlow is someone you have to put up with, that might lean towards a slightly negative sentiment because it suggests difficulty in dealing with him.\n\nHowever, there's no strong emotion here like anger or disgust. It's more of an assessment or observation rather than a heartfelt opinion. The sentiment isn't extremely negative either; it's just pointing out a condition without much elaboration on how bad it is.\n\nSo considering all this, the sentiment seems neutral but slightly leaning towards negative because of the use of \"tolerate.\" But since there aren't strong positive or very negative words, I think it's better to classify it as neutral.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 1, 33.783622554998146], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The word \"familiar\" usually has a neutral connotation\u2014it just means something is known or recognized. But then it says \"but utterly delightful.\" Now, \"utterly delightful\" is clearly positive because \"delightful\" is a strong positive adjective and \"utterly\" intensifies it.\n\nSo putting those together: the first part is neutral, but the second part strongly leans positive. The contrast here might make someone think it's just positive rather than very positive. But I should consider how much emphasis is on \"delightful.\" Since it's described as \"utterly,\" that does push it towards a higher positivity.\n\nI also need to remember the scale: 0 is very negative, 4 is very positive. So even though \"familiar\" might be neutral or slightly positive, the dominant sentiment here comes from \"utterly delightful.\" That makes me think this should be at least a 3, which is positive. But does it qualify for 4? Well, \"delightful\" is quite strong, but maybe not the strongest possible word. Maybe \"exhilarating\" would push it to 4, but \"delightful\" is solid.\n\nSo I'm leaning towards 3 because while it's definitely a positive sentiment, \"utterly delightful\" isn't as intense as something that would warrant a 4.

It says that kids aren't bothered by bad movies if there are cute animals and funny people. The words \"crappy\" has a negative connotation, but it's about the movies, not the subject directly. Then, \"cute animals\" and \"clumsy people\" sound positive because they're things that kids like.\n\nThe structure of the sentence is saying that while the movies aren't great, as long as there are these elements, kids are okay with them. So it's pointing out a positive aspect\u2014the presence of cute and funny elements\u2014that makes up for the otherwise low quality.\n\nI don't see any strong negative words beyond \"crappy,\" which is balanced by the positives mentioned.

The main points are about something that's \"playful\" but not \"fun.\" So there's a contrast here between two adjectives: playful and fun. Playful usually has a positive connotation, implying lightheartedness or amusement. Fun is also positive, indicating enjoyment.\n\nBut the phrase says it's playful without being fun. That suggests that while there's an attempt to be entertaining, it doesn't succeed in being enjoyable. The word \"without\" here negates the second part, so even though it's playful, it fails to be fun.\n\nThe structure of the sentence uses \"has the odd distinction,\" which means it's pointing out a unique characteristic that might not be entirely positive. \"Odd\" could imply something unexpected or perhaps slightly negative, like being unusual in a way that isn't appealing.\n\nPutting this together: The sentiment is somewhat mixed but leans towards neutral or slightly negative. It acknowledges playfulness but criticizes the lack of fun, which is a key element for enjoyment. However, since it's not outright negative and just points out a deficiency, I don't think it's very negative (0).

The phrase starts with \"it almost feels as if,\" which suggests a slightly uncertain tone. Then it mentions that the movie is \"more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us.\" This comparison implies that the movie's focus is on self-entertainment rather than providing amusement to the audience.\n\nThe key words here are \"entertaining itself\" and \"amusing us.\" The structure of the sentence suggests a preference for one over the other, with the former being what the movie is doing more. So, the speaker feels that the movie isn't as focused on making the audience enjoy it as much as it might be enjoying its own execution.\n\nNow, considering sentiment classification.

Then it mentions that the movie tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life.\n\nBreaking down the words used: \"facetious\" could imply something is not taken seriously, perhaps making fun of a genre or topic. \"Comic parody\" suggests humor, which is usually positive but combined with \"facetious\" might make it seem less sincere. \"Pulp melodrama\" refers to a dramatic style that's often over-the-top and maybe not the most serious form, which could be seen as negative or just descriptive.\n\nHowever, the phrase \"tosses around some intriguing questions\" indicates that despite the genre mix, there are deep or interesting themes being explored. This part leans positive because it highlights intellectual engagement. The overall description doesn't seem entirely negative; instead, it's a mix of different styles and elements that might appeal to certain audiences.\n\nConsidering the balance between these elements: while some terms like \"facetious\" and \"pulp melodrama\" could be seen as criticisms, they're balanced by the intriguing questions about human versus android life. The movie isn't being outright condemned but is rather described in a way that acknowledges both its humorous and dramatic sides along with deeper themes.\n\nSo putting it all together: there's no overtly negative or positive language strong enough to push it towards 0,1,3,4. Instead, the sentiment seems neutral because it's presenting facts about the movie without clear positive or negative adjectives beyond a few that could go either way. Therefore, I think the sentiment is neutral, which corresponds to 2.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 3, 45.783337706991006], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let's read the text carefully.\n\nThe sentence is: \"skin of man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics, but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the parts. The first part talks about getting \"cheap shocks\" from \"kids-in-peril theatrics.\" That sounds a bit negative because \"cheap\" implies it's not very genuine or effective. So maybe that's leaning towards 0 or 1.\n\nBut then there's a \"but,\" which often indicates a contrast. The second part says it taps into \"primal fears\" and describes adults as \"mysterious and brutal.\" This seems more intense and perhaps even a bit positive because it suggests the work is effective in evoking strong emotions, but I'm not sure if that's positive or negative.\n\nThe word \"brutal\" could be seen negatively, indicating something harsh. However, the overall effect might be respected for its ability to evoke fear, which can be seen as a positive aspect in storytelling. So maybe it's more on the neutral side because there are both negative and somewhat respectful elements.\n\nPutting it together: The first part is slightly negative, and the second part suggests some depth but isn't overly positive. I think this would be around neutral, so 2.\n</think>\n\nThe text discusses \"cheap shocks\" negatively but acknowledges deeper fears positively, balancing out to a neutral sentiment.\n\n2", 2, 3, 35.533202048012754], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The sentence provided is: \"only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to understand its components. The phrase starts with \"only those most addicted,\" which suggests a restrictive group\u2014those who are really into something. In this case, it's \"film violence in all its forms.\" So, the speaker is saying that only people who are heavily into violent films will appreciate whatever is being discussed.\n\nThe word \"addicted\" carries a negative connotation because addiction is generally viewed negatively. It implies an excessive or unhealthy interest. Additionally, the mention of \"violence\" further contributes to a negative sentiment since violence isn't typically seen as positive.\n\nThe latter part of the sentence says that these people will find something to appreciate. While \"appreciate\" is a neutral word on its own, in this context, it's tied back to the previous point about film violence. So the appreciation is for something violent, which doesn't necessarily make it positive but rather specific and possibly critical.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence seems to express a somewhat negative sentiment because it's targeting only those who are heavily into film violence, implying that others might not find value or appreciate whatever is being discussed. However, it's not extremely negative; there's no strong emotional language like \"horrific\" or \"terrible.\" It's more of a neutral-negative leaning towards the lower end.\n\nSo considering the scale: 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit here because the sentiment isn't extremely harsh. The sentence is critical but not overly so. Therefore, it falls into category 1 (negative) rather than 0.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence targets a specific audience with a critical tone regarding their interest in film violence, indicating a negative sentiment without being extremely harsh.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 2, 40.47710063800332], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It's a rhetorical question, which often expresses the speaker's feelings more strongly. They're questioning whether investing in an animatronic bear with \"subtlety and warmth\" is an advantage. That part sounds somewhat positive because they're talking about investing effort into something that has these qualities.\n\nBut then it contrasts by saying humans are acting like puppets. The word \"puppets\" usually carries a negative connotation, implying lack of control or being manipulated. So the speaker might be criticizing human behavior as lacking in genuine warmth compared to an animatronic bear, which is ironic and perhaps negative towards humans.\n\nThe overall tone seems critical and a bit sarcastic. They're highlighting that focusing on an artificial creation's qualities while people are behaving negatively suggests disappointment or frustration with human actions. This makes the sentiment more on the negative side.\n\nConsidering the scale, 0 is very negative, so if I think this is somewhat negative but not extremely so, maybe it falls into 1 (negative). It doesn't seem extremely negative because it's more of a pointed critique rather than an outright attack.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is critical and sarcastic towards human behavior compared to an animatronic bear.

The text provided is: \"quitting may be a flawed film , but it is nothing if not sincere .\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to understand its components. The user starts by saying \"quitting may be a flawed film.\" The word \"flawed\" has a negative connotation, implying that there are shortcomings or defects in the movie. So this part seems to express some negativity.\n\nHowever, the second part of the sentence is important too: \"but it is nothing if not sincere.\" This phrase uses a double negative\u2014\"nothing if not\"\u2014which actually means it's very sincere. The word \"sincere\" is positive, suggesting honesty and genuine emotion in the film. So this part counters the initial negative statement.\n\nNow, putting it all together: while the movie has flaws (negative), it's praised for being sincere (positive). I need to determine which sentiment outweighs the other or if they balance out.\n\nIn sentiment analysis, when a sentence contains both positive and negative elements, the overall sentiment is often neutral unless one aspect is emphasized more. Here, \"flawed\" is balanced by \"nothing if not sincere.\" The use of \"but\" suggests that despite the flaws, the sincerity stands out, which might lean towards a slightly positive sentiment.\n\nBut wait, the first part clearly states it's flawed, so that's negative. The second part is a positive note but not necessarily strong enough to make the overall sentiment positive. It could be seen as more neutral because both aspects are acknowledged without leaning heavily in one direction.\n\nAlternatively, considering \"nothing if not sincere\" is quite emphatic, perhaps indicating that despite flaws, the film's sincerity makes it somewhat praiseworthy, which might tip it towards a slightly positive sentiment.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit torn. On one hand, there's a clear negative point about being flawed. On the other, the positive note about sincerity is strong but not so strong as to negate the flaw entirely. So maybe the overall sentiment is neutral or slightly positive.\n\nWait, if the user says it's \"nothing if not sincere,\" that phrase usually means it's very much something\u2014in this case, sincere. So even though it's flawed, its sincerity makes up for it, which might lean towards a positive sentiment but not extremely so.\n\nI think I'll go with 3 (positive) because while acknowledging the flaws, the emphasis on sincerity is a significant positive aspect that stands out. However, since it's still balanced by the negative point, maybe 2 (neutral) is safer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sentence leans more towards a positive sentiment because the sincerity is highlighted as a strong positive despite the flaws. So I'm considering between 2 and 3.\n\nAfter thinking about it, I think the emphasis on \"nothing if not sincere\" gives enough weight to make the overall sentiment slightly positive, so I'll go with 3.\n</think>\n\nThe text acknowledges both flaws (negative) and sincerity (positive), but emphasizes the latter. \n\n3", 3, 2, 66.65473847600515], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The phrase \"who cares\" can often express a lack of concern or interest in something. But I should consider the context as well.\n\nLooking at the punctuation, there's a question mark and then \"-rrb-.\" The \"-rrb-\" might be some sort of notation, maybe indicating an abbreviation or a typo. It could be part of a larger text that wasn't included here. Without more context, it's a bit confusing. However, focusing on \"who cares\" is the main sentiment.\n\nNow, considering the options: 0 (very negative), 1 (negative), 2 (neutral), 3 (positive), 4 (very positive). \n\nThe phrase \"who cares\" can sometimes be neutral if someone is genuinely asking for others' opinions. But more often than not, when used rhetorically, it's expressing frustration or negativity. So in this case, I think the sentiment leans towards negative.\n\nHow strong is that negative sentiment? If it were a stronger statement like \"nobody cares\" with an exclamation mark, it might be 0 (very negative). But here, it's just a question with a possible typo or notation after. It doesn't seem extremely intense. So perhaps it's a moderate negative.\n\nI'm thinking maybe between 1 and 2. If I consider the possibility that the person is genuinely seeking others' opinions without frustration, then neutral (2) makes sense. But if they're expressing frustration, then negative (1). Since \"who cares\" can be either depending on context, but more often negative in tone when used rhetorically.\n\nSo, putting it together, I think the sentiment is negative, so 1.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the text is negative because of the rhetorical use of \"who cares,\" which typically conveys frustration or indifference. \n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 44.64965036898502], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Then, \"someone gets clocked.\" I know that \"clocked\" can mean hit or struck, which is a negative action. So, it seems like every few minutes, someone is getting hit, which isn't a positive thing.\n\nThe phrase implies a recurring negative event, maybe in a workplace or situation where people are getting reprimanded or physically struck. This could indicate frustration or a stressful environment. \n\nSo considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, etc. The sentiment here is clearly negative because of the frequent unpleasant incidents. But it's not extremely so; it's just consistently negative without any strong emotional language beyond that. \n\nI think assigning a 1 makes sense because while the situation is negative, it doesn't seem to convey extreme negativity like a 0 would.

The first part says that the filmmakers aim to show us a good time. That sounds positive because wanting to provide enjoyment is a good intention. Then it mentions they do this in a \"cheap, B-movie way.\" Hmm, \"cheap\" can have negative connotations, implying low quality or poor production. But then it says they succeed. So despite the cheap methods, they manage to achieve their goal of making people enjoy the film.\n\nI need to weigh these parts. The intention is positive, but the execution method is described as cheap and B-movie, which are usually seen as lower quality. However, the fact that they \"succeed\" in showing a good time might indicate that despite the low budget or unconventional approach, it was effective. So maybe the overall sentiment isn't entirely negative.\n\nPutting it all together: The filmmakers' goal is positive, and they achieved it, but their method wasn't high quality. It's a bit mixed. I think it leans more towards positive because success in achieving the intended effect usually has a positive spin, even if the means were not the best. But since it's described as \"cheap\" and \"B-movie,\" maybe it's not super positive either.\n\nSo on the scale, 0 is very negative, which doesn't fit. 1 is negative; I don't think so because they did succeed in providing a good time. 2 is neutral, but there's a positive outcome mentioned. Maybe 3 for positive since they achieved their goal despite the limitations. However, some might see the \"cheap\" as too negative, making it closer to neutral or slightly positive.\n\nWait, another angle: The word \"succeed\" is positive. Even though the means were cheap, the result was a good time. So maybe the sentiment is more positive than not. But I don't think it's very positive because of the criticism about being cheap and B-movie style.\n\nI'm torn between 2 and 3. Let me see: \"succeed\" in showing a good time is definitely positive, but the way they did it was criticized as cheap. So overall, maybe it's neutral with slight positivity. Or perhaps more on the positive side because success is highlighted.\n\nConsidering that, I think the sentiment is slightly positive. Maybe 3 (positive) or 2 (neutral).

The sentence is: \"It's incredible the number of stories the Holocaust has generated.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part means. The word \"incredible\" can sometimes be tricky because it can mean something positive or just surprising. In this context, it's describing that there are a lot of stories about the Holocaust.\n\nThe Holocaust is a very sad and tragic event in history, so talking about its impact might bring up negative feelings. However, the way the sentence is phrased doesn't explicitly express sadness or anger. Instead, it's more about acknowledging the vast number of stories that have come out of it.\n\nSo, breaking it down: \"incredible\" here probably means surprising in a neutral sense, not necessarily positive. The focus is on the quantity of stories rather than the emotions attached to them. Therefore, the sentiment isn't particularly negative or positive; it's more factual.\n\nI think the sentiment here would be neutral because there's no strong emotion expressed\u2014just an observation about how many stories exist.

The word \"wearisome\" isn't extremely harsh; it's more on the moderate side.

On the other hand, \"powerful\" is more neutral to slightly positive since it can mean strong or impactful.\n\nNow, I need to consider how these two words interact. The phrase combines both elements. Since \"troubling\" is clearly negative and \"powerful\" could be seen as a positive trait depending on context, but here it might just describe intensity without a clear positive spin.\n\nConsidering the overall sentiment, the negative aspect from \"troubling\" seems stronger than any potential positivity from \"powerful.\" However, the presence of both words might make the sentiment not extremely negative.

The use of backticks around the phrase indicates it might be emphasizing a technical term or a specific reference, but regardless, the context is negative.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence criticizes the movie for becoming disorganized and confusing, to the point where it leads to a critical error in its script. This is clearly a negative sentiment because it's pointing out significant flaws that detract from the viewing experience.\n\nI don't see any positive words or elements here; everything points towards dissatisfaction with how the movie progresses.

The phrase \"what's with all the shooting?\" could imply frustration or alarm because shooting usually has negative connotations\u2014like violence or danger. But without more context, it's hard to tell if they're upset, concerned, or just curious.\n\nThe word \"shooting\" itself is neutral in some contexts but can be negative when referring to acts of violence. The person might be expressing dissatisfaction, which would lean towards a negative sentiment. Alternatively, maybe they're just stating an observation without emotion, making it neutral.\n\nI also notice the use of commas and quotation marks, which might indicate emphasis or surprise. The exclamation mark at the end adds some intensity, suggesting strong feelings, likely negative.\n\nSo putting it all together, I think the sentiment is more on the negative side because they're questioning something that's generally seen as a problem. It doesn't seem overly positive or extremely negative, so maybe around 1 (negative).

It mentions it's an \"unintentional parody.\" Parody usually means a humorous imitation of something else. So, if it's a parody, that could have a positive connotation because parodies are often funny or entertaining. However, it says it's unintentional, which might imply that whatever is being parodied isn't meant to be a joke but comes off that way.\n\nNow, considering the subject: \"every teen movie made in the last five years.\" Teen movies can vary in quality. Some are well-received, while others get criticized for being clich\u00e9 or unoriginal. If this text is saying it's an unintentional parody of these movies, it might be pointing out that the work lacks originality and is just repeating common tropes seen in teen movies.\n\nPutting it together, the statement could be suggesting that whatever is being referred to isn't bringing anything new but instead is just copying what's already been done. That might come off as slightly negative because it implies a lack of creativity or effort. However, since it's an unintentional parody, maybe there's a bit of humor or light-heartedness in the critique.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being neutral or slightly negative.

Words like \"conquer\" and \"obstacles\" indicate a positive sentiment because they suggest success despite difficulties.

There\u2019s no negative language here, just a message of hope and strength through collaboration.\n\nConsidering the scale, 0 is very negative, 4 is very positive.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should consider what the phrase actually means. It's talking about journalism during the 1960s. Now, I know that the 1960s were a time of significant social change in many countries, especially in the U.S. with movements like civil rights, anti-war protests, and the Vietnam War. Journalism during this era played a crucial role in reporting on these events.\n\nBut does the phrase itself have any inherent sentiment? It doesn't use words that are clearly positive or negative. It's more of a neutral statement about a subject matter\u2014journalism from a specific time period. There's no explicit opinion expressed here; it's just stating a fact.\n\nI should also think about the context in which this phrase might be used. If someone is discussing journalism in the 1960s, they could be talking about its impact, how it changed society, or perhaps the challenges journalists faced during that time. However, without additional words or context indicating approval or disapproval, it's hard to assign a sentiment.\n\nMaybe I can consider any implicit sentiments. For instance, some people might view 1960s journalism as groundbreaking because of its role in exposing government misconduct (like Watergate, though that was in the 70s) or covering important social issues. Others might criticize it for sensationalism or bias. But again, without explicit language, these are just possibilities.\n\nAnother angle is to look at the structure and choice of words. The phrase doesn't include adjectives like \"incredible\" or \"terrible,\" which would tip the sentiment scale. It's straightforward: subject (journalism) + time period (1960s). So there's no emotional language here.\n\nI could also consider if the phrase is part of a larger context that I don't have access to. For example, if it were in a sentence like \"The journalism of the 1960s was pivotal,\" then the sentiment would be positive due to the word \"pivotal.\" But as a standalone phrase, it's neutral.\n\nTherefore, after considering all these points, I conclude that the sentiment is neutral. There are no words indicating positivity or negativity, just a factual reference.\n</think>\n\n2", 2, 2, 50.24953328401898], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

It mentions \"quiet\" and \"confident craftsmanship,\" which sounds positive because confidence usually implies skill and assurance. Then it talks about a \"sweet\" and \"charming tale.\" Both of those words are definitely positive adjectives.\n\nThe phrase is describing something in a complimentary way, highlighting both the quality of the craftsmanship and the heartwarming nature of the story. There's nothing negative mentioned here; everything seems to be praised.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sentiment feels very positive. Words like \"confident,\" \"sweet,\" and \"charming\" are strong indicators of positivity.

That suggests enjoyment or fun.\n\nNext, the part about the effects being boosted to the size of a downtown hotel and taking you to outer space seems to be praising the visual effects. Using such vivid language indicates that the effects are impressive and immersive.\n\nPutting it together, both parts of the sentence express positive feelings towards the movie\u2014enjoyment from the entertainment aspect and praise for the special effects. There's no negative language here; everything points towards a favorable view.\n\nSo considering the scale where 0 is very negative to 4 being very positive, I would rate this as a 3 because it's definitely positive without any superlatives that might push it to a 4.\n</think>\n\nThe text is positive.

So the person (Lux) is being praised for her performance.\n\nThe structure of the sentence seems to highlight different roles she plays: narrator, Jewish grandmother, and subject. That combination sounds like a compliment because it shows versatility. The fact that the film combines biography, entertainment, and history suggests it's informative and engaging, which are positive traits.\n\nThere's no negative language here. Words like \"great,\" \"combination act,\" and the variety of elements in the film all contribute to a positive sentiment. \n\nSo putting it together, the sentiment is definitely positive. But how strong? It uses \"great\" but doesn't use superlatives like \"amazing\" or \"incredible.\" So maybe a 3 (positive) instead of a 4 (very positive). Alternatively, since it's highlighting multiple positive aspects without any negative qualifiers, it could be very positive.\n\nWait, the user mentioned Lux is in her eighties. That adds context but doesn't affect sentiment directly. It just sets the scene. The main focus is on her performance and the film's elements.\n\nHmm, \"great combination act\" \u2013 that sounds quite positive. So maybe 3 or 4?

It mentions \"Linklater fans\" and \"pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde.\" The phrase \"suck up to this project\" stands out. \"Suck up\" usually has a negative connotation, implying that someone is overly flattering or trying too hard to impress, maybe insincerely.\n\nSo the sentence seems to be criticizing these fans for being pretentious and fawning over the project in an exaggerated way. The overall tone is negative because it's pointing out the insincerity or excessive flattery of certain people towards the project.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive.

Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the words used. \"Trouble\" usually has a negative connotation, indicating problems or difficulties. Then \"plodding mess\" \u2013 plodding suggests something slow and tedious, while mess implies disorder or confusion. Both of these terms are negative, so that leans towards a negative sentiment.\n\nThe structure is talking about a narrative where every day is filled with trouble. That sounds like a consistently negative experience. The use of \"is a plodding mess\" reinforces the idea that it's not just occasional trouble but an ongoing, frustrating situation.\n\nI don't see any positive words here. It's all about problems and a messy, slow narrative. So, putting this together, the sentiment is definitely negative. Now, how negative? Since both descriptors are quite strong\u2014trouble and mess\u2014it's more than just slightly negative. But it doesn't seem to reach the level of very negative (0), maybe because it's not using extreme language like \"disaster\" or \"catastrophic.\" It's consistently negative but perhaps not as severe.\n\nSo, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative. The text seems to fit into a moderately negative category without being extremely harsh. Therefore, I think the sentiment score should be 1.\n</think>\n\nThe text expresses a negative sentiment with descriptors like \"trouble\" and \"plodding mess,\" indicating consistent problems but not extreme negativity.\n\n1", 1, 1, 35.50390831398545], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the sentences start with \"not yet\" and \"not quite.\" These phrases usually indicate something is lacking or incomplete. So, when they say she's \"not yet an actress,\" it suggests that she hasn't reached that status yet. Similarly, saying she's \"not quite a singer\" implies she might not be fully there in that role either.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about what these negations imply. They could mean that her skills or achievements aren't at the level expected for those roles. Maybe she's still developing or hasn't had enough experience. It doesn't necessarily say she won't get there, but right now, she isn't quite fitting into either category.\n\nIs there any positive spin here? Well, maybe it's a neutral observation about her current status without any strong emotion. Alternatively, could this be negative because it's pointing out what she hasn't achieved yet? But I don't see any harsh language or overly critical terms; it's more of an assessment.\n\nSo, considering the options: 0 is very negative, which doesn't seem right because there's no strong negative words. 1 is negative, but again, the tone isn't overtly negative. It's more like a factual statement about her current status. Neutral would be 2, but I'm leaning slightly towards negative because it's pointing out what she hasn't achieved yet, even if politely.\n\nWait, maybe it's actually neutral. The phrases \"not yet\" and \"not quite\" are somewhat tentative, not really positive or negative. They just state a fact without emotion. So perhaps the sentiment is neutral rather than negative.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit torn. On one hand, pointing out that she hasn't achieved these titles could be seen as slightly critical. But on the other hand, it's presented in a way that doesn't express strong negativity. Maybe 2 for neutral is safer because there's no clear positive or negative emotion expressed.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses phrases like \"not yet\" and \"not quite,\" which indicate her current status without strong emotions, making it neutral.\n\n2", 2, 2, 47.176545583002735], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The subject here is a \"moral favorite,\" suggesting that this person is liked for their moral qualities. \n\nThen, it continues with \"friends will be friends through thick and thin.\" This part is a well-known saying that emphasizes loyalty and enduring friendship despite difficulties.

The tone here is definitely positive because it's focusing on positive traits like affection, loyalty, and friendship.\n\nI don't see any negative words or implications in this sentence.

They suggest that the work has depth and emotional impact.\n\nPutting it all together, the text seems to describe something that's more on the positive side. It doesn't use strongly negative words, so I don't think it's 0 or 1. Neutral would be 2, but there's a clear positive spin with \"evocative\" and \"heartfelt.\" So maybe 3 for positive.\n\nI should also consider if any part could be interpreted differently.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each word individually. The phrase starts with \"winning,\" which immediately gives a positive vibe because winning usually means success or achievement. Then there's \"wildly fascinating.\" The word \"wildly\" acts as an intensifier here, making the adjective \"fascinating\" stronger. So putting those together, it seems like both words are contributing positively to the sentiment.\n\nNow, considering the context, when someone describes a work as \"winning and wildly fascinating,\" they're likely expressing admiration or approval. There's no negative language here; instead, it's all about something being successful and intriguing. \n\nI should also think about the intensity of these words. \"Winning\" is positive but not extremely so. However, when paired with \"wildly fascinating,\" which uses a strong modifier, the sentiment becomes quite positive. It suggests that the work isn't just good\u2014it's exceptional in capturing attention.\n\nIs there any possibility of ambiguity or sarcasm? The phrase doesn't have any words that hint at sarcasm, and both adjectives are clearly complimentary. So I don't think there's an alternative interpretation here.\n\nPutting it all together, \"winning\" is a 3 on the scale (positive), and \"wildly fascinating\" pushes it further towards 4 because of the intensifier.

It's a question asking if it's too early for Barry Sonnenfeld to make a self-homage as a director. The phrasing \"a bit early\" suggests that maybe his career hasn't been long enough yet. But is this negative or just neutral? \n\nThe word \"homage\" usually has a positive connotation, but here it's about him doing one for himself, which could imply self-indulgence rather than something respectful. Maybe the speaker feels he should focus more on other projects before making something that's about his own work.\n\nSo putting this together, is the sentiment negative or neutral?

Dragging usually isn't a good thing in movies or stories; it means it's not engaging. Then, \"underscoring the obvious\" \u2013 this makes me think they're pointing out something too obvious, maybe making it feel forced or lacking depth. Lastly, \"sentiment is slathered on top.\" Slathering implies that sentiment is being applied thickly, perhaps in a way that feels excessive or unnatural.\n\nPutting it all together, the text seems critical of how scenes are dragged out and how emotions are overly applied.

It's talking about a remake, so maybe the original was okay but this version isn't great. \"By the numbers\" suggests it's formulaic or uninspired, which doesn't sound good. Then there's \"halfwit plot,\" which is definitely negative\u2014calling the plot unintelligent.\n\nNext part: linking this halfwit plot to standup routines where Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie. So while their comedic skills are acknowledged, it seems like the current project isn't utilizing them properly. The implication is that they didn't reach their potential here because the movie wasn't ambitious enough.\n\nPutting this together: The reviewer doesn't seem to think highly of the remake.

The phrase starts with \"a rather tired.\" The word \"tired\" generally has a negative connotation, implying something that's been done too often and lacks freshness. Using \"rather\" as an intensifier here makes it more noticeable.\n\nNext, \"exercise in nostalgia.\" Nostalgia itself can be positive or neutral because it relates to fond memories. However, combining it with \"tired\" changes the sentiment. The term \"tired exercise\" suggests that while there's some value (as nostalgia isn't inherently bad), the execution is lackluster or overdone.\n\nSo putting it together, the overall sentiment seems negative but not extremely so. It\u2019s more about criticism than outright hostility. Therefore, I don\u2019t think it's 0 (very negative) because it doesn't express extreme dislike.

It starts with \"not as good as the original,\" which immediately tells me that something is being compared negatively to an original version. That phrase usually indicates dissatisfaction or disappointment because whatever is being discussed isn't up to the standard of what came before it. So this part is definitely negative.\n\nThen, the sentence continues with \"...but what is ...\". This part seems a bit vague and incomplete. It doesn't give me much information about the sentiment, so I can't really assess it based on that alone. Maybe the user was in the middle of writing something else or got interrupted? Without more context, this part isn't helpful for determining sentiment.\n\nSo focusing back on the first part: \"not as good as the original.\" This is a common expression used when someone is disappointed with an updated version, sequel, or anything that's supposed to be similar but falls short. For example, if someone says a movie wasn't as good as the original, they're expressing disappointment.\n\nNow, considering the scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive), I need to place this sentiment accordingly. The first part is clearly negative, so it's not neutral or positive. But how negative exactly?\n\nIt doesn't use strong language like \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" just a straightforward comparison saying it's not as good. So maybe it's moderately negative rather than extremely negative. On the scale, 1 represents negative and 0 is very negative. Since it's a direct but not overly harsh criticism, I might lean towards 1 instead of 0.\n\nWait, but sometimes even \"not as good\" can be quite impactful depending on context. If someone really loved the original, saying it's not as good could carry significant disappointment. However, without more context or stronger negative words, I think 1 is a safer choice than 0.\n\nThe second part of the sentence doesn't add any positivity because it's incomplete and doesn't provide any positive sentiment.

The text starts with \"horrendously amateurish,\" which immediately strikes me as a strong negative adjective. Using \"horrendously\" amplifies how bad it is, so that's a big clue towards a very negative sentiment.\n\nNext, the phrase continues with \"filmmaking that is plainly dull.\" Dull isn't great, but when combined with the previous words, it adds to the overall negative impression. The word \"plainly\" emphasizes that there's no mistaking its dullness, which again points to negativity.\n\nThen there's \"visually ugly,\" which directly criticizes the film's appearance. Ugly is a harsh term and definitely contributes to a negative sentiment. The use of \"ugly\" here isn't just mild dissatisfaction; it's a strong criticism of the visual aspect.\n\nThe sentence ends with \"when it isn't incomprehensible.\" Incomprehensible means difficult or impossible to understand, so saying that sometimes the film is incomprehensible adds another layer of negativity. This suggests that not only is the film bad in some parts but also confusing or hard to follow in others.\n\nPutting all these together: \"horrendously amateurish,\" \"plainly dull,\" \"visually ugly,\" and \"incomprehensible\" are all strongly negative descriptors. Each word adds to a cumulative effect of intense dissatisfaction. The adverbs like \"horrendously\" and \"plainly\" also make each adjective more impactful, indicating that the sentiment isn't just slightly negative but very so.\n\nSo considering all these elements, the sentiment expressed here is extremely negative. Therefore, it would fall under 0, which represents very negative.\n</think>\n\nThe text uses strongly negative adjectives like \"horrendously amateurish,\" \"dull,\" \"visually ugly,\" and describes parts as \"incomprehensible.\" These terms clearly convey a very negative sentiment.\n\nAnswer: 0", 0, 0, 42.12752807600191], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

The text is: \"a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling.\" Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each word to understand their meanings. \"Rote\" usually means something done without thinking, mechanical, maybe even boring. So that could be a negative connotation because it suggests lack of creativity or effort. \n\nNext, \"exercise\" in this context probably refers to an activity, but when combined with \"rote,\" it might imply that the activity is repetitive and not engaging. That adds more to the possibly negative sentiment.\n\nThen, \"animation and storytelling\"\u2014these are both creative fields, so if someone describes them as a rote exercise, they might be criticizing the lack of innovation or originality. So maybe the person feels that the animation and storytelling weren't done well because they were just going through the motions without any fresh ideas.\n\nPutting it all together, \"a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling\" seems to express dissatisfaction with how these elements were handled. It suggests that instead of being creative or engaging, they were done mechanically or unoriginally.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment scale: 0 is very negative, 1 negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, 4 very positive. Since the text criticizes the lack of creativity and effort, it's leaning towards a negative sentiment. But how strong is that negativity?\n\nThe phrase doesn't use strongly negative words like \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" Instead, it uses \"rote,\" which implies something more mechanical but not entirely without value. So maybe it's not extremely negative but still on the negative side.\n\nI think this would be a 1 because while there is criticism, it's not overly harsh.

The first part says it's never laugh-out-loud funny. That sounds a bit negative because it's pointing out something lacking\u2014laughter that makes you laugh out loud. But then the second part says it's frequently amusing. Amusing means it's enjoyable or entertaining, so that's positive.\n\nSo there are two parts here: one slightly negative and another more positive. I need to weigh them. The first part is a bit of a downer but maybe not too strong because it's just saying it doesn't reach the level of being laugh-out-loud funny. The second part is definitely a plus, emphasizing that it's amusing often.\n\nPutting it together, the overall sentiment isn't negative enough for 0 or 1.

The text is: \"you get the idea , though , that kapur intended the film to be more than that.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They want me to determine whether the sentiment expressed in this text is very negative (0), negative (1), neutral (2), positive (3), or very positive (4). So my output has to be just one integer from 0 to 4.\n\nLooking at the sentence, it seems like it's talking about a film directed by Kapur. The structure is a bit choppy with some commas and \"though,\" which might indicate a slight contrast or afterthought. The main point here is that Kapur intended the film to be more than something else. \n\nI'm thinking about what the phrase \"more than that\" implies. It suggests that the film has deeper meaning or aspects beyond what was initially perceived or discussed. So, if someone says that the filmmaker intended it to be more than just a surface-level story, they might be appreciating the complexity or depth of the film.\n\nBut wait, does this necessarily mean positive sentiment? The sentence doesn't explicitly state whether this intention is good or bad. It's more about pointing out that there was an intent beyond what might have been obvious. Without any negative adjectives like \"unsuccessful\" or \"disappointing,\" it seems neutral.\n\nI should consider if the use of commas and the word \"though\" adds any nuance. The phrase could be setting up a contrast, but since the rest of the sentence doesn't provide that contrast, it might just be a way to introduce an idea. So maybe the speaker is saying that although something was expected, the film actually has more depth.\n\nIn terms of sentiment analysis, neutral (2) would make sense here because there's no clear positive or negative language. The focus is on intent rather than evaluation. \n\nI don't see any strong indicators of positivity or negativity. It's informative about Kapur's intentions without expressing approval or disapproval.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, looking at the words used. \"Just another\" often implies something is unoriginal or not particularly impressive. Then \"disjointed\" suggests that the story isn't well-connected or coherent. That doesn't sound positive. \n\nNext, \"fairly predictable\" means that the plot wasn't surprising. In thrillers, unpredictability can be a big plus, so predictability here might be seen as a negative. Finally, it's calling it a \"psychological thriller,\" which is a genre, but the adjectives before it are more telling.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment seems negative because of the words like \"disjointed\" and \"predictable.\" However, it's not extremely negative since there aren't harsher terms. So maybe it's a 1 (negative) or perhaps even neutral?

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the sentence carefully: \"Oops, she's really done it this time.\" The word \"oops\" immediately stands out. It usually indicates that something went wrong or there was a mistake. So right away, that suggests a negative connotation.\n\nNext, looking at \"she's really done it this time,\" the phrase \"done it\" here likely means she made a significant mistake. The use of \"really\" emphasizes that this is not just a minor error but something more substantial. The word \"this time\" might imply that there have been past instances where similar things happened, which adds to the negative sentiment because it suggests recurring issues.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence expresses frustration or disappointment about her making another mistake. There's no positive language here; instead, it points out a failure or error, which clearly leans towards negative feelings.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, 3 positive, and 4 very positive. The sentiment here isn't extremely harsh\u2014there are stronger words that could be used to express more intense negativity. However, it's definitely a negative statement because of the use of \"oops\" and the implication of failure.\n\nSo, I think this sentence is negative but not the most severe kind of negativity. It fits somewhere in the middle on the negative side. Between 0 (very negative) and 1 (negative), I'd say 1 is more appropriate here. The sentiment isn't extremely negative; it's just a negative statement expressing disappointment.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence expresses disappointment, using \"oops\" to indicate a mistake and implying frustration with recurring issues.

The main subject here is \"Williams,\" and it seems like they're being praised for something. The phrase \"absolutely nails\" suggests that Williams did a great job in capturing or portraying something accurately. So that's a strong positive indicator.\n\nNow, looking at what Williams nailed: Sy's \"queasy infatuation\" and \"overall strangeness.\" Queasy can mean uneasy or uncomfortable, but when paired with \"infatuation,\" it might describe an intense or perhaps unsettling admiration. Strangeness here likely refers to something unusual or unconventional about Sy. \n\nSo, putting it together, the text is saying that Williams did a fantastic job portraying these aspects of Sy. Even though words like \"queasy\" and \"strangeness\" have slightly negative connotations on their own, in this context, they're being praised as part of an accurate portrayal rather than expressing personal feelings about Sy.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment expressed isn't just positive but very strong because of the use of \"absolutely nails,\" which is a strong compliment.

The text provided is: \"busy urban comedy is clearly not zhang 's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. It starts by saying that busy urban comedy isn't Zhang's forte. \"Forte\" means something you're good at or strong in, so this suggests that Zhang doesn't excel in this genre. That already leans towards a negative sentiment.\n\nNext, it talks about his directorial touch not being light nor magical enough. Words like \"light\" and \"magical\" are usually positive descriptors, implying creativity or flair. The text is saying he lacks these qualities when it comes to bringing off whimsy, which again points to a criticism of his work in this area.\n\nPutting it together, the statement is pointing out that Zhang isn't skilled in creating this type of comedy and that his style doesn't fit well with the whimsical elements required. This is definitely a negative assessment of his abilities in this context.\n\nNow, considering the scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is very negative and 4 is very positive.

It mentions Jackie Chan getting older. That part could be neutral or maybe slightly negative because aging can sometimes have negative connotations, especially if it's about someone known for their physical abilities or action roles. But then the next part says the person would rather live in denial about it. Living in denial usually implies that they don't want to accept something, which might indicate a negative feeling towards the situation.\n\nSo putting it together, the sentiment seems negative because the speaker doesn't like Jackie Chan getting older and is avoiding accepting this fact. The use of \"rather\" suggests preference against it, adding to the negativity. There's no positive language here; instead, there's a desire to avoid reality, which leans towards a negative sentiment.\n\nNow, considering the scale: 0 is very negative, 1 is negative, 2 neutral, etc. Since it's expressing a clear dislike and avoidance of an aging situation, I think it should be at least a 1 (negative). But does it reach 0? Very negative would imply strong dislike or something more severe. The statement here seems to express mild negativity because they are in denial but not necessarily expressing anger or extreme frustration.\n\nSo maybe it's a 1 on the scale.\n</think>\n\nThe sentiment expressed is mildly negative due to the desire to avoid acknowledging Jackie Chan's aging, which indicates dissatisfaction with the situation.\n\nAnswer: 1", 1, 1, 35.7041290080233], ["Given the text below, you must classify how negative or positive is the sentiment it expresses.

Let's look at the sentence: \"nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that 's giving it the old college try.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the words. \"Match\" here might mean they are comparable or equal in some way. \"Pure venality\"\u2014venality refers to corruption or greed, so this is a negative term. So, saying they match their own creations for pure venality suggests that what they're doing is corrupt or greedy.\n\nThen there's \"that's giving it the old college try.\" The phrase \"old college try\" usually means putting in maximum effort, often despite low expectations. But in this context, given the previous part about venality, it might be implying that even though they tried hard, their efforts are still negative because of greed.\n\nSo overall, the sentiment seems negative because of the use of \"venality,\" which is a strong negative word. However, it's not extremely negative because the rest isn't loaded with other negative terms. So maybe it's somewhere between 1 (negative) and 2 (neutral).

The words used are quite strong. \"Mean-spirited\" immediately stands out as a negative term, suggesting the film has a spiteful or unkind nature. That's a clear indicator of negative sentiment.\n\nNext, looking at the second part: \"made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia.\" Here, they're implying that the filmmaker, despite reading a notable book, has dyslexia. The way it's phrased seems mocking or critical. It suggests that even though the person is educated (read the book), their dyslexia is causing issues, which could mean poor execution in the film.\n\nSo putting it together, both parts of the sentence express negative feelings about the film and its creator. The first part directly calls out the film's nature as mean-spirited, while the second mocks the filmmaker's capability. This makes the sentiment very negative.\n\nI don't see any positive or neutral terms here. It's all criticism and sarcasm.

So first, I need to understand what this sentence means. \n\nI know that in sports, especially basketball, an \"air ball\" is a shot that doesn't hit the rim or backboard and just goes way off target. It's usually considered a bad shot because it's so far from making it into the basket. So when someone says \"Hollywood's answer to an air ball,\" I'm thinking they're comparing something from Hollywood to this negative concept of a missed shot.\n\nNow, considering the context, maybe they're talking about a movie or some project that was released by Hollywood. If it's called their \"answer\" to an air ball, that suggests it's similar in some way\u2014perhaps it's not very good or misses the mark entirely. So this could be implying that whatever Hollywood produced is as bad or off-target as an air ball.\n\nSentiment-wise, negative terms like \"air ball\" are clearly not positive. But how negative exactly? The user wants to classify it on a scale from 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive). Since the comparison is to something that's universally seen as a mistake or failure in sports, I think this would lean towards negative sentiment.\n\nBut is it extremely negative? Or just slightly negative? Well, an air ball isn't the worst thing in the world\u2014it's more of a mistake than a disaster. So maybe it's not at 0 (very negative), but perhaps around 1 or 2. But considering that the user used \"answer to,\" which might imply they're directly comparing it as similar, it could be more on the negative side.\n\nWait, I'm overcomplicating it. The term \"air ball\" itself is a clear indicator of something going wrong. So if someone refers to Hollywood's project as their answer to an air ball, it's likely a criticism. Therefore, the sentiment here is negative. On the scale, that would be either 0 or 1.\n\nBut 0 is very negative. Is this extremely negative? Or just moderately so?

The text is \"interesting , but not compelling.\" So first, let me break down each part.\n\n\"Interesting\" generally has a positive connotation. It means something catches one's attention in a good way. However, it's followed by \"but not compelling,\" which introduces a negative aspect because \"not compelling\" suggests that while there was some interest, it didn't fully engage or convince the person.\n\nPutting those together, the sentiment isn't purely positive or negative. The use of \"but\" indicates a contrast between something positive and something less so. So the overall feeling is mixed but leaning towards neutral since one part is positive and the other is slightly negative without being overly strong in either direction.\n\nI should consider if this leans more towards neutral than anything else. Since neither emotion is very intense, it's probably not a 2 for neutral. Wait, no, actually, \"interesting\" could be seen as somewhat positive but not strongly so.

Let me start by reading the text carefully.\n\nThe sentence is: \"It's not like having a real film of Nijinsky, but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break this down. The speaker is talking about two films related to Nijinsky: one real film they're referencing and a specific 1980 biopic.\n\nThe first part says, \"It's not like having a real film of Nijinsky.\" This seems negative because it's comparing the current subject (maybe another film or portrayal) unfavorably to an idealized real film. The word \"not\" here suggests disappointment or dissatisfaction.\n\nThen, they say, \"but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic...\" So now they're shifting to a comparison with another film. Using \"at least\" indicates that while the current subject isn't great, it's still preferable to something else. That suggests some positivity because they found it better.\n\nNext part: \"...that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered.\" This is likely a critique of the 1980 biopic, implying that it didn't handle certain aspects well. Using \"soap\" metaphorically could mean it was overly dramatic or sensational, perhaps lacking depth. So this is another negative point about the older film.\n\nPutting it all together: The speaker starts with a criticism but then finds some value in the current subject by comparing it to something worse. This creates a mix of negativity and positivity.\n\nHow strong are these sentiments? The initial statement is somewhat negative, but the comparison makes it less so because they're saying at least this film is better than another bad one. It's not overly positive; it's more about relief that it's not as bad as expected or compared to something else.\n\nSo on the scale of 0 (very negative) to 4 (very positive), I think a neutral stance might be appropriate here because while there are both negative and slightly positive elements, neither sentiment is extremely strong.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the phrase starts with \"mediocre,\" which is neutral but leaning negative because it's not good. Then it says \"spirals downward,\" which definitely sounds bad\u2014like getting worse over time. The word \"thuds\" gives a sense of something heavy and unpleasant happening, so that's another negative point. Finally, it mentions an \"utterly incompetent conclusion.\" Incompetent is a strong negative word, and adding \"utterly\" makes it even more severe.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentiment seems really negative. The structure starts not great and gets worse, ending with a bad conclusion. So I think this would be classified as very negative.\n</think>\n\n4", 4, 0, 18.79958180099493]]
